### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT C.CustomerID, C.FirstName, C.LastName, SUM(SOH.SubTotal) AS TotalSpent
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS C
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH ON C.CustomerID = SOH.CustomerID
GROUP BY C.CustomerID, C.FirstName, C.LastName
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Join Tables**:
   - The `Customer` table is joined with the `SalesOrderHeader` table using `CustomerID`.

2. **Aggregate Total Spent**:
   - The `SUM(SOH.SubTotal)` calculates the total amount spent by each customer by summing the subtotal of all their sales orders.

3. **Group by Customer**:
   - Grouping is performed on `CustomerID`, `FirstName`, and `LastName` to consolidate spending for each customer.

4. **Sort and Limit**:
   - Results are sorted in descending order by `TotalSpent` to prioritize highest spenders.
   - Limited to the top 10 customers using `OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY`.

| christopher1@adventure-works.com  | 1              |
| ... (Additional rows available)   |

### Final SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT C.EmailAddress, COUNT(SOH.SalesOrderID) AS TotalOrders
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS C
INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH ON C.CustomerID = SOH.CustomerID
GROUP BY C.EmailAddress
ORDER BY TotalOrders DESC;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Join Operation**:
   - The query joins `Customer` with `SalesOrderHeader` using `CustomerID` to match customers with their orders.

2. **Aggregate Orders**:
   - `COUNT(SOH.SalesOrderID)` calculates the total orders associated with each customer.

3. **Group Customers**:
   - Grouping by `EmailAddress` ensures order counts are aggregated by customer emails.

4. **Sort Results**:
   - Results are sorted in descending order of `TotalOrders` to show customers with the highest number of orders.

### Observation:
All listed customers appear to have placed 1 order each. If you'd like to dive deeper into customers with higher numbers of orders, make sure there is sufficient data reflecting multiple orders per customer, or let me know if you need additional analysis!",2025-05-12 12:12:11.239256

2. **Filtering Criteria**:
   - The query filters orders where `OrderQty` exceeds 5 to focus on large orders.

3. **Aggregate and Count**:
   - `COUNT(SD.SalesOrderDetailID)` calculates the frequency of each product appearing in large orders.
