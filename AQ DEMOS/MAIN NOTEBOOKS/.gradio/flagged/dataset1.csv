### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT C.CustomerID, C.FirstName, C.LastName, SUM(SOH.SubTotal) AS TotalSpent
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS C
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH ON C.CustomerID = SOH.CustomerID
GROUP BY C.CustomerID, C.FirstName, C.LastName
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Join Tables**:
   - The `Customer` table is joined with the `SalesOrderHeader` table using `CustomerID`.

2. **Aggregate Total Spent**:
   - The `SUM(SOH.SubTotal)` calculates the total amount spent by each customer by summing the subtotal of all their sales orders.

3. **Group by Customer**:
   - Grouping is performed on `CustomerID`, `FirstName`, and `LastName` to consolidate spending for each customer.

4. **Sort and Limit**:
   - Results are sorted in descending order by `TotalSpent` to prioritize highest spenders.
   - Limited to the top 10 customers using `OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY`.
