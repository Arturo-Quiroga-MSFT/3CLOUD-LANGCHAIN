A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Proceeds from the issue by the third-largest U.S wireless carrier will be used for general corporate purposes, Bloomberg data show. The securities are rated B1 by Moody’s Investors Service, four levels below investment grade, and one step higher at BB- at Standard & Poor’s. Sales of dollar-denominated junk-rated debt this year of $242.5 billion exceed the $202.9 billion sold in the corresponding period of 2012, Bloomberg data show. Borrowers issued a record $357.3 billion of high-yield debt last year. The sale is the largest high-yield offering since June 2008, when Intelsat priced $7.1 billion of bonds through three units, Bloomberg data show. Yields on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index have declined to 6.86 percent as of yesterday from a record high 22.65 percent during the credit crisis in December 2008 and reached an unprecedented low of 5.98 percent on May 9. Offering Increased The size of Sprint’s sale was earlier set at a minimum of $4 billion, a person familiar with the transaction said yesterday. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest underwriter of junk debt, led the offering. Sprint was bought by SoftBank Corp. in July for $21.6 billion in founder Masayoshi Son’s bid to make the Overland Park, Kansas-based company a stronger rival against Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., owners of the two biggest U.S. wireless carriers. Tokyo-based SoftBank’s takeover included a $5 billion cash infusion, giving Sprint money to bolster its network and pursue acquisitions.

The economy will expand 4 percent to 5 percent this year, the central bank said in its quarterly monetary policy report released today, down from its previous estimate of between 4.5 and 5.5 percent. Prices will probably rise 2.6 percent in 2013, slower than the 2.8 percent it estimated three months ago. Policy makers may cut the 5 percent benchmark interest rate in line with market expectations, which see the rate at 4.5 percent to 4.6 percent by the end of the year, the bank said. The key rate has remained unchanged since February 2012. In its previous monetary policy report the bank had indicated it was preparing to raise rates after increasing its growth forecast. “The signals in the past few months indicate that the external and internal conditions have started to normalize,” the bank said. “The Chilean economy is on a good footing to face the changes.” Chile ’s economy expanded 4.1 percent in the first quarter form the year earlier, the slowest pace in three years. Available data suggests that the slowdown continued in the second quarter, the bank said today. While consumer demand remains strong with near-record low unemployment and bank loans to consumers rising 10 percent year-on-year in the first half, investment is weakening, the bank said. Chile’s real exchange rate, an inflation-adjusted measure of the peso’s strength relative to its peers, is within a range coherent with economic fundamentals, the bank said. Economists polled by the central bank on June 10 said they expected the bank to reduce rates to 4.75 percent by July and to 4.5 percent by December. Traders and investors surveyed on June 26, after the June 19 Federal Reserve meeting, said they expected the bank to hold the rate at 5 percent in July and cut to 4.75 percent by the end of this year.

Retail assets are the highest since December 2007, when it managed 81.3 trillion yen, he said. Nomura’s domestic retail business, accounting for almost half of its pretax securities profit, is benefiting from a stock rally spurred by investors’ expectations that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s stimulus plans will revive the world’s third- largest economy. The jump in assets may boost the Tokyo-based company’s brokerage commissions, which climbed 13 percent to 83.7 billion yen in the quarter ended Dec. 31.

Chris Coons today became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Bankruptcy and the Courts after a vote by the Judiciary Committee, replacing fellow Democrat Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. The subcommittee also oversees new judgeships, court administration and legal reform. “For those who like Delaware as a bankruptcy venue, this is a good development,” said Samuel J. Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute , a professional organization representing lawyers and others in the restructuring field. Delaware and New York dominate large corporate bankruptcies, according to a database compiled by University of California , Los Angeles , Professor Lynn M. LoPucki. The latest effort to loosen their influence came in 2011, when lawmakers from Texas and Michigan tried to change the rules about where companies can file bankruptcy. Coons defended Delaware’s position, saying the judges and attorneys in his state have expertise that can speed corporations through bankruptcy and “preserve jobs where possible.” “In jurisdictions that don’t have the same capacity, in terms of experience on the bench and the strength of bankruptcy bar, it can, at times, be difficult,” Coons said in an interview today. Fifth Judge A subcommittee of the Judicial Conference of the U.S. this month recommended adding a fifth judge to Delaware ’s federal district court to handle an increase in the number of patent cases filed in the state. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware has six judges. Coons said it will be difficult to get the additional judge approved by Congress. “There are strong opponents to adding any new judges anywhere in the country,” he said. The Senate should concentrate on approving nominations for vacant federal judgeships that are funded, Coons said. Senate confirmation is required to fill a post, and there are 85 judicial vacancies and 33 nominees awaiting approval. Any company incorporated in Delaware can file for bankruptcy there, or wherever it has its headquarters or operations. Representative Lamar Smith , the Texas Republican who chairs the House judiciary panel, and Michigan’s John Conyers , its ranking Democrat, have proposed forcing companies to file in their home states. Many lawyers outside of Delaware and New York support efforts to curb filings in the states, Gerdano said.')\n",

That\\'s a shame, considering how much they owe her for the freedoms they enjoy. The daughter of Russian Jewish parents achieved some notoriety in the mid-1990s with her memoir , \"The Only Woman in the Room.” It chronicled the unlikely role of a 22-year-old woman crafting Japan\\'s post-war constitution. The team\\'s only female member was entrusted by Gen. Douglas MacArthur to draft its women\\'s-right section. Gordon\\'s musician family emigrated to Japan in the late 1920s and she saw first-hand how few rights women had -- they were merely property. She helped make sure the all-important Article 14 made it into the final document. It stated, in terms that in 1946 were nothing short of revolutionary: “All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin.” For generations, Gordon stayed out of the limelight. She feared that the conservative men running post-war Japan would exploit her youth and inexperience to revise the constitution. She joined the Asia Society in New York in the 1950s, where she had an illustrious career focusing on performing arts. Thankfully, Gordon began speaking out more in recent years, recounting her experiences in Tokyo during the U.S. occupation. It\\'s time for Japanese to take up the flame of a woman some consider their answer to Gloria Steinem. Nearly 67 years after Japan\\'s constitution was written, sexism remains rampant. In 2012, the World Economic Forum ranked Japan 101st out of 135 countries in gender equality , after Indonesia and Azerbaijan. Such inequality holds back Japan\\'s economy by reducing the quality of its labor force. Women must demand their due. Japan’s history, as Gordon would surely agree, is replete with flashes of feminist energy, but few caught on in a cohesive, sustained and formidable way. A little Steinem-style agitation, or even taking a page from “ Lysistrata ,” might go a long way in a nation badly in need of an economic shakeup. After all, those in power don’t tend to yield it easily, least of all Japan ’s old-boys club. (William Pesek is a Bloomberg View columnist. Follow him on Twitter.)

Revenue advanced 11 percent to 1.11 billion pounds. “Help to Buy acted as a catalyst for underlying consumer demand and helped increase our sales values,” Chief Executive Officer Ted Ayres said by phone.

Here is some of what I’ve been reading this morning. In case you forgot, many of Europe’s banks are still a mess Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world’s oldest bank, said it suspended interest payments on three bond issues. Bloomberg News said the move came “after European authorities demanded bondholders contribute to the restructuring of the bailed out Italian lender.” Can’t help but wonder: Now that the German elections are done, what other European banking scandals and sovereign-debt blowups might surface? There’s no way Europe’s banks have cured themselves. And we’ve been hearing the same refrain all year from European Union officials that nothing much could get done until Angela Merkel was re-elected. The Guardian had an article over the weekend on this same subject: “This year summer has been extended, and Europe's leaders seem to be hanging around even longer before doing anything meaningful. They have been waiting, of course, for the German elections today before springing into action with long wish lists for the reinvention of Europe.” Maybe our grandkids will succeed in closing Fannie and Freddie Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal has some good, pithy lines in this piece on the outlook for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “The firms are proving to be as difficult to shut down as the U.S.-operated Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba,” he writes. “The real debate boils down to this: Should all Americans continue to have relatively easy access to the pre-payable, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage?” The answer probably is no, but good luck getting most Americans or members of Congress to agree. How to lose $46 million on a single house And you thought the losses in the U.S. housing crash were bad? The Irish Times had an article over the weekend about a property developer, David Arnold, who lost 34 million euros ($46 million) buying a single residence in the Dublin suburb of Foxrock in July 2006 with a mortgage from the Bank of Ireland. He once planned to demolish the home and turn the grounds into a residential-and-retail complex. But that’s not happening. So now the property is back on the market.

Government of Singapore Investment Corp. , the world’s eighth-largest sovereign wealth fund, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute , is set to buy four of MSR’s resorts for $1.5 billion. The IRS and Five Mile alleged that the sale created a tax liability of as much as $331 million that may not be paid. “All objections and all reservations of rights that have not been withdrawn, waived, or settled pertaining to confirmation are hereby overruled on the merits,” Lane said in an order filed today. The Singapore fund is buying the Grand Wailea in Hawaii , La Quinta Resort & Club in California , the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa in Phoenix and the Claremont Resort & Spa in Berkeley, California. A fifth resort, the Doral Golf Resort & Spa in Miami , was sold to Donald Trump in June. The resorts entered bankruptcy protection in 2011 after a joint venture including Paulson acquired them through foreclosure. Secured Debt Today’s ruling came after a hearing earlier this month where witnesses for MSR testified that the company wasn’t trying to hide the tax liability, and that it would be incurred by a real estate investment trust that isn’t in bankruptcy. The plan provides for repayment of 96 percent of secured debt and 100 percent of general unsecured debt, according to a Jan. 31 court filing by MSR. Five Mile stood to lose about $58 million, including investments by pension funds and other parties, David Friedman, a lawyer for Five Mile, said during the hearing. The resorts sought approval in August for an auction with GIC as the lead bidder. The auction was canceled after no competing bids were received, according to a court filing in December. “When we came into bankruptcy, people thought the world was going to get better a lot faster,” Basta said in court on Feb. 4. By August, “Five Mile couldn’t get their deal together,” he said.

The PRA, the Bank of England’s new banking supervisor, last month outlined 13.4 billion pounds ($20 billion) that lenders must raise by the end of 2013 to withstand possible losses on loans, fines and other risks. It had previously found a capital shortfall of 27.1 billion pounds. “In the long term, Moody’s expects U.K. systemic risk will be reduced by higher capital requirements , including significant loss-absorbing and counter-cyclical capital buffers,” it said. “The stable outlook for the system is compatible with the stable outlook on the standalone credit assessment of most U.K. banks.”')\n",

Profit excluding impairments and other one-time items was 10 cents a share, beating the 6-cent average of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

Gold-mining companies have announced at least $17 billion of writedowns in the past two months after the metal’s steepest quarterly drop in London trading in more than nine decades.

The last time a waterfront estate of a similar size sold in Greenwich was in 1954, according to Ogilvy. There are 46 properties in the city listed for more than $10 million, two of which are in escrow, according to Mark Pruner, an agent with Prudential Connecticut Realty in Greenwich. A comparable sale has yet to be completed this year, he said. “No comps come anywhere close in value,” Pruner said in a telephone interview. “The high-end market is the slowest.” The priciest previous sale in Greenwich was a 4-acre waterfront estate that sold for $39.5 million last year, Ogilvy said. The highest recorded sale price for a U.S. home was the $117.5 million SoftBank Corp. (9984) founder Masayoshi Son paid last year for an estate in Woodside, California.

The gated community it’s in, Mead Point, is zoned for two-acre home lots, and the new owner would need the Greenwich town council’s approval to subdivide further, Ogilvy said. “Much of the value may be in subdividing this 50-acre property in a 2-acre zone,” Pruner said in an e-mail. “But, in this case, the private association rules and the neighbors will provide the greatest protection to over-development.” The listing was reported previously by the Wall Street Journal.')\n",

The trade-off may still lead to longer lines at airport security checkpoints, Bodtmann said today at a press conference in Washington. The agency relies on overtime to fill gaps in staffing, and the hiring freeze promises to exacerbate the situation, she said. “I see it already -- little increases in wait times -- and it’s eventually going to get worse,” said Bodtmann, a TSA screener at New Jersey ’s Newark Liberty International Airport, which she said is short as many as 75 workers due to hiring freezes. Bodtmann said she was aware of the agency’s plans from conversations with officials at the Homeland Security Department, which includes the TSA. The automatic spending cuts triggered March 1 would total $85 billion in the remaining seven months of the fiscal year, and $1.2 trillion over nine years, assuming Congress and President Barack Obama don’t agree before then on an alternative. The reductions would be divided equally between defense and domestic programs. Airport Lines TSA will freeze hiring, reduce overtime and make other cuts across the agency, said Marsha Catron, a Homeland Security spokeswoman.

The company's stock price was soaring at a split-adjusted high of $59.56 just weeks before Ballmer took over as CEO in January 2000, and since that year, it has never closed above $40. Wall Street's tacit disapproval of Ballmer is an important factor in the executive's legacy as the company, which reports earnings later today, searches for his successor. But there are other numbers that help define the 13-year tenure of the software giant's second CEO. Ballmer is no Bill Gates, but he presided over a six-fold increase in server-software sales, now one of the company's largest businesses. Sales from the Office unit tripled. Ballmer instituted dividends that would have yielded $8.23 for investors who have held the stock the whole time the CEO was in charge. (Many of them didn't.) There was no Xbox for sale before Ballmer. After amassing huge losses early on, it's gone on to generate $7.1 billion in sales during the last fiscal year. Perhaps more important, people actually love the product. Even the Windows business, Microsoft's original cash cow, has more than doubled in sales since Ballmer became CEO. But that number doesn't tell the full story. In 2000 , PCs were really the only computing device in town for most people, and Windows had more than 90 percent of the market. With the advent of smartphones and tablets, and Microsoft's complete failure to amass share there, Goldman Sachs estimated last year that Windows runs on just 19 percent of the computing devices consumers use. That's the number that should cause the most agony for Ballmer's successor.\")\n",

Fernandez in a national address yesterday called on businesses to maintain prices as she pledged to increase annual social program spending to 41.1 billion pesos ($7.8 billion) to help consumers and fuel growth. The 60-year-old president said there are “monopolies” in the cement and steel industries who will have to discuss pricing with the government “We are going to use political, social and youth groups throughout the country to watch and take care -- watch prices and take care of Argentines pockets,” Fernandez said. “We want to improve social programs and boost consumption and economic activity.” Interior Commerce Secretary Guillermo Moreno is in talks with supermarkets to freeze prices of about 500 goods, Fernandez said. In February, supermarkets and home supply stores agreed to a 60-day price freeze that was extended to 120 days. The social spending plan includes a 35 percent increase in monthly payments to poor families with children that will benefit 1.8 million families, Fernandez said last night. The increase in spending is above what private economists estimate for inflation as the government seeks to help poor families maintain purchasing power, said Ramiro Castineira, an economist at Buenos Aires-based research firm Econometrica. ‘Effect Disappears’ Those funds will go straight to consumption as those families spend all they have on basic goods, he said. “Price accords always work at the beginning but then their effect disappears,” said Castineira said in a telephone interview last night. “Inflation is a macroeconomic problem, not a problem caused by lack of controls.” Unemployment (ARUERATE) in South America ’s second-biggest economy rose to 7.9 percent in the first quarter, the highest since 2010, after the economy expanded 1.9 percent in 2012, the slowest pace since 2009.

The country’s budget surplus , excluding interest payments, narrowed in February to 204 million pesos from 700 million pesos a year earlier. Last year, the government had a deficit equal to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, the worst shortfall since the 3.3 percent gap posted in 2001.

Rapeseed processing by the 27 countries of the EU may be 6.37 million metric tons in the four months through the end of June, down 7.9 percent from the same time last year, with most of the drop coming in Germany and France , the Hamburg-based researcher said today in an e-mailed report. In the first eight months of the 2012-13 marketing year, which began July 1, rapeseed crushing rose 5.4 percent from a year earlier to 15.54 million tons. EU rapeseed stockpiles in early March were 800,000 tons smaller than in 2012, it said. “Crushings of the three major oilseeds are set to decline in the European Union in the last four to five months of this season,” Oil World said. “Crushings were frontloaded in the first half of 2012-13. This is true primarily for rapeseed and resulted in a reduction of rapeseed stocks.” The EU is the world’s biggest producer and consumer of rapeseed, used in biofuel and for cooking. It’s the second- largest importer of soybeans, after China , and the third-largest producer and user of sunflower seed, after Ukraine and Russia , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. EU soybean crushing in February was 940,000 tons, down from 950,000 tons in the same month in 2012 and compared with a 12 percent annual jump in processing in January, Oil World said. Lower supplies in South America, where logistical problems have delayed shipments, “decimated” EU soybean crushing in February and March and the trend may continue in April, it said. Tight Supplies “Soya meal supplies have tightened significantly, mainly as a result of delayed arrivals of South American soya meal at the European ports,” Oil World said. “Supply relief can only be expected in the European Union from the end of May or early June onward. Argentine and Brazilian soybean crushings were unusually small until March but have reportedly started to recover pronouncedly in April.” Sunflower seed crushing totaled 1.05 million tons in January and February in the EU, down 16 percent from last year, bringing the total processed since August to 3.94 million tons, 10 percent less than the previous season, Oil World said.

Of that total, 116.1 billion reais is the central government’s surplus target while 51.2 billion reais corresponds to the surplus expected from states and municipalities. Currently, if states don’t meet their target, the federal government’s target is affected. “We’re suggesting the hypothesis of reducing the target for some functions, which are those that the country understands as being more important, such as investments and tax cuts,” Augustin told reporters in Brasilia today. “The target is there, but it doesn’t necessarily need to be accounted for by the federal government if, eventually, it’s not met,” he said. For Newton Rosa , chief economist at Sul America Investimentos, the relaxation means more public spending. Sul America sees Brazil’s central bank increasing the Selic rate 0.5 percentage point this week. “It’s a sign that the government will continue to reduce its primary surplus, it will work with a smaller target,” he said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “If you’re already in a scenario of increasing rates, the onus on monetary policy becomes heavier.” Latin America ’s largest economy expanded 0.9 percent last year, the slowest pace in three years.

The bonds, to be sold through a general public offer, will have tenors of seven, 10 and either 20 or 25 years, Ayala Land said in a stock exchange filing today. President Antonino Aquino said the proceeds will be used to partly finance the company’s 65.5 billion peso spending plan this year. “The high liquidity in the domestic capital market looking for good corporate paper should allow us to place these bonds at attractive rates,” Aquino said in a mobile-phone message in response to Bloomberg questions today. Profit at the developer of Manila ’s Makati business district climbed to a record 9.04 billion pesos in 2012, helped by a 6.8 percent expansion in the $225 billion economy, the fastest pace of growth in two years. First-quarter net income rose 30 percent to 2.76 billion pesos, the company said May 8. Ayala Land expects to expand last year’s record profit as the builder takes advantage of a housing shortage and develops business districts outside the capital, Aquino said in a March interview. The company in February announced plans to start 69 projects worth 129 billion pesos this year, while its Chief Financial Officer Jaime Ysmael said at the time it will spend 20 billion pesos to boost its land bank. The bond sale comes about three weeks after a May 31 explosion at its Two Serendra residential development that killed three people. Gas that may have been ignited by static electricity, a light-bulb spark or other sources may have caused the blast, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said on June 7. Market Outlook “The bond sale will be well-received by the market because Ayala Land has good credit standing,” Miguel Agarao, an analyst at brokerage Wealth Securities Inc. in Manila, said by telephone. “Even if property sales are impaired by the explosion at Serendra, it won’t affect the company’s ability to repay the bonds.” Ayala Land raised 15 billion pesos of 5.625 percent seven-year notes and 6 percent 10-year debt in April last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s 10 billion peso offering in January 2011 included 7.5 percent 15-year bonds, the longest maturity for a Philippine corporate debt.')\n",

April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, a lesbian couple seeking to adopt each other’s children, contend a 2004 amendment to Michigan’s constitution conflicts with the equal protection guarantees of the U.S. Constitution. The Michigan amendment was passed by popular vote. “Marriage is a fundamental right,” Carole Stanyar, attorney for DeBoer and Rowse, argued today before U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman. “Fundamental constitutional rights should not be subject to popular vote.” The U.S. Supreme Court is considering the issue of same-sex marriage and Friedman said he won’t rule on the couple’s challenge until after the high court’s decision. Joseph Potchen, attorney for the state, told Friedman that the Michigan amendment didn’t harm anyone’s rights. “Equal protection and due process are not violated,” Potchen told the judge. “Sexual orientation is not a protected right.” Adopting Sons The plaintiffs contend DeBoer was blocked from adopting Rowse’s two sons and Rowse couldn’t adopt DeBoer’s daughter because of the Michigan Marriage Amendment. The law barring same-sex marriage denied them the adoption rights available to married couples as well as other protections including inheritance rights, they claim. “Michigan has the worst laws in the country for gay people and their children,” Stanyar said today. “They have no hope of enhancing their rights in the political arena. No hope for change.” Potchen asked Friedman to dismiss the lawsuit. “Those are great arguments to be made before the Legislature,” Potchen told the judge. “Under its sovereign authority, Michigan’s laws defining marriage as being between a man and a woman are valid and beyond federal constitutional challenge,” the state’s lawyers said in court papers. “The definition of marriage is fundamentally a state decision.” The case is DeBoer v.

The seasonally adjusted index increased to 53.6 from 49.1 in January, Johannesburg-based Kagiso said in an e-mailed statement today. An index level below 50 indicates a contraction in factory output. The Bureau for Economic Research , based at the University of Stellenbosch near Cape Town , conducts the PMI survey for Kagiso. “The significant improvement in new sales orders may reflect a turnaround in demand for locally-manufactured goods,” Abdul Davids, the head of research at Kagiso Asset Management, said in the statement. “Tentative indications of an improvement in the EU and U.S. economies at the start of this year may have contributed to the increased demand for manufactured goods and a sustained recovery in demand will require improved gross domestic product growth in these regions.” Africa’s largest economy grew 2.1 percent, more than expected, in the final quarter of last year as manufacturing and agricultural output expanded. The rand has this year fallen 6.2 percent versus the dollar, making South African goods more competitive in the European Union and other overseas markets.

The rules, introduced last November, triggered “no compelling impact” on the liquidity of EU government bond markets, the European Securities and Markets Authority said in an e-mailed statement. Still, the EU should make some technical changes to the law to clarify the rules for trading credit-default swaps linked to sovereign debt, the Paris-based ESMA said. “The introduction of the short-selling regulation has had some positive effects in terms of enhancing market transparency and reducing risks of settlement fails in EU financial markets,” said Steven Maijoor, ESMA’s chairman. Lawmakers approved the curbs in 2011 in a bid to make markets less volatile and tame speculation by traders who they blamed for driving up governments’ borrowing costs. The rules included a ban on investors buying and selling credit-default swaps on sovereign debt unless they have a clear financial stake in whether the government defaults. Nations can opt out of the measure if they are concerned that it would raise their borrowing costs. “So far, there does not seem to have been a noticeable adverse effect on EU sovereign-debt markets themselves,” ESMA said. “However, there has been a decline in activity for sovereign CDS in a few EU countries and sovereign CDS indices,” it said. “There is, therefore, a need to keep this area under close review.” Naked CDS Investors buy credit-default swaps as insurance to protect themselves from losses if a bond issuer defaults. A sovereign CDS trade becomes naked when an investor buys the swap without being at risk of suffering such losses. The U.K. is seeking to overturn the law at the European Court of Justice, claiming that powers handed to ESMA by the legislation are in breach of the bloc’s treaties. The law gives ESMA the power to introduce pan-EU short-selling bans. ESMA said lawmakers should consider a series of technical changes to the law, to make it clearer and improve how it works in practice. The suggested changes include clearer wording on which trades are covered by the naked CDS ban. The EU should also simplify rules for when regulators can introduce targeted short-selling bans in response to a sudden plunge in a company’s share price, ESMA said.')\n",

Ditzik, alleged that Apple infringes a patent for a handheld device that combines computer and wireless-communications functions over both a Wi-Fi and a cellular network. Damages he can win in the trial are limited to sales of Apple’s iPhone 4 in the past 13 months. Scarsi said Ditzik’s initial patent application in 1997 was for a handset that made calls through a laptop computer and that the inventor later changed the patent claims to put e-mail and other functions in the handset rather than in the computer. Scarsi asked the jury to find that the patent was invalid and not infringed by Apple’s iPhone. Apple “shamelessly” stole Ditzik’s invention, NetAirus’s lawyer, Ray Niro, said in his closing statement. “Apple somewhere along the line lost their way,” Niro told the jurors. “They lost their sense of responsibility.” Niro said a royalty of $500,000 would be reasonable for Apple’s use of the patented technology.

Why the U.S. should want to increase its exposure to Europe, paralyzed by a financial and debt crisis, isn’t immediately obvious. Most economists nowadays tend to focus on how to boost trade with the fast-growing emerging economies, such as Brazil, Mexico and China. Yet trade between the U.S. and EU accounts for more than one-third of all global trade flows. More U.S. exports go to Europe than to China. A U.S.-EU trade accord can unleash a huge untapped stimulus for both sides of the Atlantic, at a time when the U.S. and Europe are deleveraging. For Europe, trade liberalization could coax companies to boost their competitiveness, something that European politicians have been loath to do for fear of retribution at the voting booth. For the U.S., an increase in trade could spur sluggish job growth. As with most agreements, the devil will be in the details. Tariffs between the U.S. and Europe are already low, so the greatest gains in a new trade deal will come to reductions in non-tariff barriers. There are a number of sticking points, particularly related to agricultural products, aircraft manufacturers and pharmaceuticals. Still, the proposed agreement now has some powerful champions, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron. Business leaders and labor unions on both sides of the Atlantic favor a deal as well. Take advantage of this momentum and get a deal signed this year.

The Commission, which has to approve state aid to companies, demanded a new plan to justify the 2.2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) of aid Hypo Alpe has received since 2008. “An agreement with the European Union’s competitive authorities shouldn’t take precedence over the company’s well-being and the costs,” Ditz said in an e-mailed statement. “Setting a deadline isn’t justifiable” for Hypo Alpe’s main asset, a network of banks in ex-Yugoslavia. The lender should also spin off a “bad bank” for wind-down assets because that could limit capital requirements for taxpayers, Ditz said. European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia has called to break up Hypo Alpe by year-end and threatened to shut it down after five years of talks between EU and Austrian officials failed to produce a wind-down plan.

Judge Alan Malott in Albuquerque ruled yesterday that denying gay couples the right to marry violates the New Mexico constitution. State rules require couples wishing to marry to obtain a license and doesn’t define or limit the definition of “couples” to heterosexual, he said. New Mexico, whose voters chose a Republican governor in 2010 and President Barack Obama , a Democrat, in the past two presidential elections, is the only U.S. state that has no law related to same-sex marriage or civil unions. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit this year on behalf of gay couples who were denied marriage licenses. Malott said the under state’s domestic affairs law, which says applications for marriage licenses must be filled in by a “male applicant” and “female applicant,” it’s “arguable” that gay marriage is illegal. Yet it’s “beyond argument” that the state constitution says equal rights can’t be denied on the basis of sex, and “implying conditions of sexual orientation on one’s right” to marry violates the constitution, Malott said. ‘Intolerable Pattern’ Gays and lesbians in New Mexico “have endured a long history of discrimination,” and denying the right to marry “continues this unfortunate, intolerable pattern,” he ruled. “Our state is now on the brink of joining the growing list of states who live and honor the values of family, liberty and love,” Peter Simonson, executive director of the ACLU in New Mexico, said in an e-mail. “Every family in this state is made richer by this step toward justice for all.” Micah McCoy, an ACLU spokesman, said it isn’t clear what effect the ruling will have on other counties in New Mexico. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples legally married in states that allowed it. The court also reinstated a federal judge’s order allowing gay marriages in California. The New Mexico case is Griego v.

The Internal Revenue Service , in a notice on its website yesterday, said whistle-blower awards will be reduced by 8.7 percent under automatic spending cuts that kicked in this month. The cutback applies to the IRS payout of as much as 30 percent of the additional tax, penalty and other amounts it recovers from scofflaws. Under budget cuts known as sequestration, the U.S. is trimming $85 billion from federal spending in the remaining seven months of the current fiscal year. The fiscal reductions may stay in place for weeks as Congress and the administration of President Barack Obama negotiate over a fresh deadline of March 27, when the government’s authority to spend money expires. “I have more questions than answers,” Senator Charles Grassley , the Iowa Republican who wrote the 2006 law updating the IRS whistle-blower rules, said in an e-mail today. The payments are made by the IRS, using money collected from companies and individuals who committed tax fraud , and cutting rewards would undermine the program, he wrote. “What’s the legal rationale for cutting the whistle-blower payments?” ‘Baffling’ Erika Kelton, an attorney with Phillips & Cohen LLP in Washington who represents tax and other whistle-blowers, called the IRS decision “completely baffling.” Given the rarity of IRS whistle-blower awards -- fewer than a dozen have been publicly announced out of more than 1,200 claims filed -- Kelton said it’s unlikely the IRS will make any awards before the budget standoff is resolved. “After all, an 8.7 percent reduction of nothing is still nothing,” she wrote. Among recent beneficiaries of IRS whistle-blower awards was Bradley Birkenfeld, a former UBS AG employee who received $104 million last year after telling the government the bank helped thousands of Americans evade taxes. The IRS paid 128 awards worth a total of $125.4 million in fiscal 2012 to whistle-blowers who helped collect $592.5 million in revenue, according to a report on the IRS website.

Huang said the agreement was reached on Nov. 15, without disclosing more information. The rates this year were $70 a ton and 7 cents a pound, according to Jiangxi.

Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co., China’s second largest copper producer, will probably use Jiangxi’s agreement as a benchmark in its own talks with miners, said board secretary Wu Heping.

The new pope was elected after five ballots over two days by the 115 voting cardinals under the age of 80. Benedict was chosen in four votes over two days in 2005. The quickest modern- era conclave came in 1939, according to Vatican Today website, when Pope Pius XII won in three ballots over two days. “Each of us must work to build up the unity of the church,” Italy ’s Angelo Sodano, the highest-ranking cardinal, said at a mass before the so-called princes of the church began voting yesterday in the 15th-century Sistine Chapel, which is adorned by Michelangelo’s famed fresco of the Last Judgment.

The drop helps cut their cost of deposits, he said. Upgrade Inflows Standard & Poor’s upgraded Turkey to one level below investment grade on March 27, matching the rating from Moody’s Investors Service. Fitch Ratings raised Turkey to investment grade in November. “Until the last week of March, there was a pronounced slowdown in foreign capital inflows,” Gizem Oztok Altinsac, an economist at Garanti Investment in Istanbul, said in a note to investors today. This picture changed after the March 27 rating upgrade from S&P, Altinsac said, noting that the acceleration in capital inflows would correspond to an “increase in loans and recovery in the economy.” The average annual interest rate that Turkish banks pay savers for one-year deposits dropped to 6.63 percent today, down from 7.05 percent at the start of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with investor expectations of 5.64 percent annual inflation, as implied by the two-year breakeven rate.')\n",

The EU will need to cut carbon emissions by an extra seven percentage points because of the surplus of allowances, which can be held over into the next decade, according to the report commissioned by Greenpeace. The 27-nation bloc has a binding target of cutting greenhouse-gas output by 20 percent in 2020 from 1990 levels, and should reduce pollution by 40 percent in 2030, according to the EU’s regulatory arm. “It is essential for the effectiveness of the EU’s emissions trading system that the trajectory of the EU’s greenhouse-gas target until 2030 is set in a way that takes into account any pre-2020 surplus,” Niklas Hoehne, director of energy and climate policy at Utrecht, Netherlands-based Ecofys, said in an e-mailed statement today. The European cap-and-trade program imposes pollution limits on about 12,000 manufacturing companies and utilities in the region, including German utility EON SE and steelmaker ArcelorMittal. (MT)  Europe ’s economic slowdown reduced industrial production and cut demand for pollution rights, boosting the surplus of permits to about 2 billion metric tons last year, a level almost matching annual supply, according to the EU. Stringent Target “Given the currently expected surplus, the 2030 target or the trajectory towards it would need to be significantly more stringent than otherwise,” Hoehne said. The permit glut pushed carbon prices in the EU emissions trading system, or ETS, to a record 2.46 euros ($3.25) a metric ton in April. The European Commission proposed delaying sales of some allowances, which member states and the European Parliament are currently considering. The stopgap measure would be followed by a deeper overhaul of the carbon market. Greenpeace called on the commission, national governments and the Parliament to support cutting carbon emissions by at least 55 percent in 2030. That target should be a part of a EU new climate and energy package that includes a 45 percent objective for renewable energy and a binding energy savings goal, according to the lobby. “This report shows the 40 percent 2030 carbon target put forward by the European Commission is woefully inadequate, especially given the impact of a failing ETS,” Greenpeace EU climate policy director Joris den Blanken said in the statement. “The EU needs a stricter 2030 target if it wants to keep the ETS alive and avoid the most severe effects of climate change .”')\n",

High-income earners may have cashed out investments early in anticipation that federal income taxes would rise as part of a congressional deal over avoiding automatic tax increases, the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office said yesterday in a report. U.S. levies on capital gains rose to 20 percent from 15 percent under this month’s agreement in Washington. “January is also the final deadline for ‘estimated tax’ payments for the prior calendar year,” the office said in the report. “Estimated taxes are paid mainly by individuals reporting capital gains, business income, and other income not subject to withholding.” Another reason, the analyst’s office said, may be that wealthy residents, who have to pay higher state income levies retroactively under a tax increase voters passed in November, chose to pay a portion of their obligations now instead of in April. Or it simply could be that the higher state rates are generating more revenue than forecast as the economy improves. “As we always caution, you can’t assume or build a long- term trend -- good or bad -- off of one month’s worth of data, because any number of factors can swing one month either way,” said H.D. Palmer, Brown’s budget spokesman in Sacramento. Running Tally While revenue this month has already topped estimates by $5 billion, reconciliation after the end of the month may change the final tally, the office said in the report. Personal income-tax withholdings are 12 percent higher than projected, while estimated payments already received are more than double the amount anticipated for the month, according to the report. Brown, a 74-year-old Democrat, persuaded voters in November to impose the highest statewide sales tax in the U.S., at 7.5 percent, and to boost levies on annual income starting at $250,000 -- reaching 13.3 percent on those making $1 million or more, the most of any state. Revenue forecast to rise by $6 billion annually for seven years under the temporary increases. The tax boost and spending cuts mean the state will end fiscal 2014 with an $851 million budget surplus , the first in a decade, according to a spending plan Brown released this month.

The government filed the case at the Netherlands’ highest court, Geertje Janssen, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Ministry of Finance, said in an e-mailed statement today. The ministry is asking the court to clarify aspects of laws that the government used to seize the assets before an investigation starts into the value of the securities, she said. Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem became the first Dutch leader to use powers granted under laws introduced last year allowing failing banks to be unwound. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal’s Enterprise Chamber ruled in July that Dijsselbloem was probably wrong to refuse compensation to investors whose securities were wiped out. The court said it would appoint investigators to define the compensation required. “The State considers it important that the Supreme Court gives its view on the issue of how certain parts of the law should be explained before the investigation ordered by the Enterprise Chambers begins,” Janssen said. SNS Reaal was nationalized after real estate losses brought it to the brink of collapse, costing the Netherlands 3.7 billion euros in write-offs and capital injections.

The proposed settlement, filed July 15 in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey , would resolve claims that the failures led to the largest recall of over-the-counter children’s medicine in U.S. history, a plant closing and a congressional probe. The group, or class-action, accord still needs a judge’s approval. The case focused on recalls of over-the-counter drugs made by J&J’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare division in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico , and Fort Washington , Pennsylvania. Investors claimed that J&J and its executives made misleading statements about details of the recalls and that they suffered stock losses after the true reasons for the recalls became public. “The proposed settlement is a favorable recovery for the class especially when viewed in light of the significant risks posed by continued litigation,” according to the filing.

Suit Dismissed J&J claimed that investors were unable to prove the materiality of alleged misstatements and omissions or how they caused shares to drop, and that company executives acted in good faith. A judge’s ruling had meant “there was a great likelihood” that the class asserted “would have been substantially curtailed,” according to the filing. U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson previously dismissed a similar suit claiming that J&J directors ignored “red flags” foreshadowing product recalls and government probes of manufacturing defects and marketing practices.

(GE) says Australia will eventually adopt an emissions-trading system even as the government seeks to repeal a carbon-price mechanism imposed on the A$1.5 trillion economy by a previous administration. “We still believe that over time there needs to be a price on carbon, there will be a price on carbon,” GE Vice Chairman John Rice said in an Australian Broadcasting Corp. interview shown yesterday. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, elected Sept. 7, has vowed to abolish the mechanism established by Labor’s Julia Gillard in 2011 as a step toward a carbon market, saying it has driven up energy prices and deterred investment. More than 300 of Australia’s largest emitters must pay an average $24.15 a metric ton for greenhouse gases this year, the highest price in the world. While Abbott’s Liberal-National coalition has a majority in parliament’s lower house, it doesn’t control the Senate, which has the power to block a repeal. The prime minister told a meeting of party members in Hobart Oct. 26 that new Labor leader Bill Shorten should support his bid to remove the carbon tax, calling it “socialism masquerading as environmentalism.” Gillard in 2011 agreed to create a carbon tax at a fixed rate for three years, starting in July 2012 at A$23 a ton, before market-based pricing commencing in mid-2015. After winning back the Labor party leadership by defeating Gillard in a June party-room vote, Kevin Rudd announced that a floating price linked to the European Union’s mechanism would be implemented a year earlier, in July 2014, at about A$6 a ton. Investment Threat Repeal would cut costs for business and manufacturers and save the average household A$521 in fiscal 2014-15, Environment Minister Greg Hunt said Oct. 16. GE’s Rice said overseas investors are seeking clarity, regardless of the outcome of Abbott’s effort to drop the tax. “Whatever the outcome is, repealing the legislation, replacing it with something else or not, investors are going to want to see that clarity,” he said. “Otherwise you’re just not going to get the right investments here.” Slowing global economic conditions had reduced the impetus for more nations to adopt emissions-trading systems, Rice said. The European Union, South Korea and New Zealand, along with regions and states in China , the U.S. and Canada , have implemented carbon-price mechanisms or plan to. “With economies under stress, it’s hard to pay the price,” Rice said. “As the global economy begins to improve, you probably will see more people go back to a level of interest in a price-per-carbon and other incentives to promote the development of renewable technologies.”')\n",

Signs of the bacterium, known as Porphyromonas gingivalis, were found in four out of 10 samples of brain tissue from Alzheimer’s patients, while no signs of the bug were found in 10 brains from people of similar age who never developed dementia, according to the results of the study published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. The findings support a theory that bacteria in the mouth enter the bloodstream through chewing or tooth removal and end up in other parts of the body including the brain, StJohn Crean, the lead researcher, said in a telephone interview. Over time, the chemicals produced by the bacteria could build up and contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s, according to the theory. “The results are very encouraging,” said Crean, the dean of the School of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Central Lancashire in England. “We’ve shown an association, not causation. It does nothing more than to prove that these bacteria do get to the brain.” While brushing and flossing can also cause bacteria to enter the blood, it’s important to frequently and effectively clean the teeth to decrease the number of bacteria and cut the chance that they will travel outside the mouth, he said. Bacterial Assault “The issue is to reduce the bacterial load that occupies our gum tissues, to reduce the bacterial assault if and when it happens,” Crean said. The study was paid for by the university, Crean said. He and his colleagues are seeking funding for additional research to explore the potential connection between the bacteria and the development of Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer’s disease and dementia mostly affect older people, and the number afflicted by the conditions is growing worldwide as populations age. The World Health Organization predicted dementia cases would triple to 115 million in 2050 from 36 million worldwide in 2010. The exact cause of the illness is unknown.

Preliminary work is accelerating on an ultra-high voltage link to deliver wind power from Jiuquan in the northwestern province of Gansu to southern Hunan, said Zhang Zhengling, deputy director of the development and planning department at China State Grid. Two grid lines are also being built to transmit power from northern Hebei to areas including Beijing and Tianjin city, he said in an interview yesterday. Grid improvements in China are necessary to deal with an influx of new energy sources. In particular, enhancements would help reduce idled wind capacity, particularly in the north. The state-owned grid operator is creating capacity in areas where the issue of idled wind power is most severe, Zhang said at a conference yesterday. The annual rate of China’s idled wind capacity may fall to 12 percent this year from 17 percent in 2012, Guo Yanheng, the deputy director of the National Renewable Energy Engineering Information Management Center, said in August. Turning wind farms off cost operators at least 10.6 billion yuan ($1.74 billion) in lost revenue last year, almost doubled 2011’s figure, according to the renewable energy center. China plans to take two to three years to resolve the issue, Shi Lishan, deputy director of the renewable energy department under the National Energy Administration, said. Wind Farms China has optimized the planning of wind farms, with new approvals centered in Shandong and Shanxi provinces and stricter controls in the north, Zhang said. The electricity lost because of wind curtailment, the term used to describe wind farms producing at less than their generation capacity, may fall at least 25 percent to below 15 billion kilowatt-hours this year from a year ago, he estimates. By the end of the year, the grid company will start operating another line from Hami in Xinjiang to Henan, which can handle 8 gigawatts of wind power and 1.25 gigawatts of solar, Zhang said at the conference.

CVS, for example, reports no foreign income. The lack of agreement on how to offset the cost of a corporate rate cut -- along with political differences over broader fiscal questions -- have prevented lawmakers from turning a general agreement on revenue-neutral corporate tax rate reduction into specific law. 25% Rate Representative Dave Camp , a Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, plans to move a comprehensive rewrite of the individual and corporate tax codes through his panel this year. He hasn’t said how he would pay for reducing the rate to as low as 25 percent. President Barack Obama last year called for dropping the rate to 28 percent and to 25 percent for manufacturers. He would eliminate breaks for oil companies, the insurance industry and private equity managers as part of the way to pay for the rate cut. The administration has also suggested options such as lengthening depreciation cycles and limiting the deductibility of interest. Many U.S. companies, particularly in the high-technology and pharmaceutical industries, don’t pay anywhere near the 35 percent rate, making them more interested in preserving breaks than cutting rates.

While previous discoveries have found dinosaur bones in the T. rex stomach, they didn’t indicate whether the animals were alive when eaten. Some scientists have argued that T. rex was too slow to capture prey and had physical characteristics of a scavenger of dead animals rather than hunter of live prey. Healed wounds on smaller dinosaurs indicate to scientists where a predator attacked them. While paleontologists have seen marks that could have come from a T. rex attack, such as punctured bones or tooth marks, there was no direct link. The new evidence is rare for good reason -- prey rarely gets away, according to the report. Survived Attack In this case, one hadrosaur , a 35-foot-long plant-eating dinosaur, escaped to tell the tale 65 million years later of its attacker through a tooth lodged in its back. Paleontologist Robert DePalma from the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History in Fort Lauderdale found parts of the hadrosaur skeleton in the Hells Creek Formation of South Dakota. When they scanned its fused vertebrae, the scientists discovered an embedded crown tooth inside the old wound. An extensive database of dinosaur teeth enabled the team to accurately identify the tooth as belonging to a T. rex. “We have the bullet and the smoking gun,” Burnham said. He says this discovery returns T. rex to the top of the paleolithic food chain. The finding also allows paleontologists to reconstruct the interaction between predators and prey in greater detail, he said. The finding doesn’t mean that the T. rex was only a hunter, as it almost certainly did scavenge carcasses as well, researchers said.')\n",

A federal judge ruled today that the world's biggest technology company violated antitrust laws by scheming with publishers to fix the prices of electronic books. Apple Inc., which plans to appeal, will probably face damages. The real loser in the ongoing e-book battle, however, continues to be the only company that exists solely to provide consumers with books: Barnes & Noble Inc. Barnes & Noble, which came to Apple's defense in the trial, had employed the same so-called agency model Apple used to compete with market-leader Amazon.com Inc. Apple let publishers set prices for the e-books it sold, then collected 30 percent of the revenue. Under the deal, publishers couldn't sell more cheaply to Amazon, which undercut Amazon's discount strategy. The agency model enabled Apple and Barnes & Noble to gain market share, but it collapsed last year when, in a settlement with the Justice Department, five major publishers agreed to drop the practice. Given that the changes in the way e-books are sold have already taken place, it's unlikely that, even with today's verdict, Apple will lose much of its share of the e-book market. In any case, e-books are only an ancillary source of revenue for the company, and a fine would merely be a slap on the wrist. Barnes & Noble has more at stake. The company lost $475 million on its Nook tablet business in the last fiscal year. It has discontinued its color tablets, and Chief Executive Officer William Lynch, who made the Nook a key part of the company's strategy, resigned Monday. Still, there's hope for Barnes & Noble. Even as the Nook business deteriorated, its retail unit became more profitable last fiscal year, generating $374.2 million in earnings, a 16 percent increase from the year before. As Matt Townsend writes in Bloomberg News, printed books still have value. The rise of e-books, which make up just 20 percent of the book market, is slowing. Publishers use Barnes & Noble to sell their older titles, since the e-book market is primarily a place for new releases. There's also the academic market: Barnes & Noble manages some 700 university bookstores, Lydia DePillis writes in the Washington Post. And where else would writers go on book tours? The Apple verdict is another wakeup call in a string of many for Barnes & Noble, which needs to turn away from the e-book battle and toward the challenges of being a bookstore.

(KARG) , the world’s largest rose grower, said it will borrow more than $100 million from a sovereign wealth fund to invest in farming in East Africa after selling its first produce from a plantation in Ethiopia. The company, based in Bangalore, India , produced 21,000 metric tons of corn in the last quarter of 2012 that sold for about $6.5 million in Ethiopia, Managing Director Sai Ramakrishna Karuturi said in a phone interview on March 27. The harvest, grown on its plantation in western Ethiopia, showed the project was “not a disaster” after floods destroyed a 60,000- ton corn crop in September 2011, he said. The deal with the unidentified fund comes after development banks declined to provide assistance because of “unfair” criticism of commercial farming by advocacy groups, Karaturi said. “Hundreds of millions” of dollars will be advanced to the company by the end of April and invested in Ethiopian projects as well as Kenyan flower farms, he said. Ethiopia’s land-commercialization drive has been attacked by groups including the California-based Oakland Institute, which says the farms forcibly displace people and will increase poverty. Karuturi leased 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) in the Gambella region from Ethiopia’s government in November 2010 for 2 million Ethiopian birr ($108,151) a year Horizon Plantations, majority owned by Saudi billionaire Mohamed al-Amoudi, leased a 20,000-hectare plot in the western Benishangul-Gumuz region in September to grow groundnuts to produce cooking oil. Jobs, Foreign-Exchange The benefits of commercial farming in lowland areas of the country include a boost to crop production to reduce hunger and more jobs and foreign earnings, according to Ethiopia’s Agriculture Ministry. Since September 2009, the central government has leased 416,803 hectares to 34 domestic and foreign investors with an average plot size of 12,259 hectares, data from the ministry’s website shows. The state identified 3.3 million hectares of land nationwide, an area about the size of Belgium , as suitable for large-scale farming. Karuturi’s contract stipulates it should develop half its plot within 12 months and the remainder the following year. The agreement starts from the date of signing or “from the date of receipt of all the clearances from the government.” The project to grow and process crops including cereals, sugar, palm oil and vegetables has “good support” from senior Ethiopian officials, Karuturi said. The leasing of an additional 200,000 hectares to the company is conditional on completion of the current phase, according to the contract. All land in Ethiopia is owned by the state.')\n",

Stock market bulls better hope those forecasts are wrong. According to the boffins in the Office of Management and Budget, corporate income in 2023 will be more than 13 percent lower than it is today -- and that's before accounting for inflation and taxes. This decline is not predicted to be smooth. Instead, the forecasters predict steady earnings growth until the beginning of 2018. Profits are then projected to fall by nearly a third over the following six years. That's a surprisingly steep decline. The projections say the share of national income earned by U.S. corporations as profits before taxes will decline from today's high of 12.4 percent. (This figure includes the standard inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments.) That makes sense. In theory, declining joblessness should give workers greater leverage over firms. The share of national income going to salaries and wages should rise, and the share going to profits should fall. But the projected fall in the absolute level of profits (not just the profit share) is bigger than you'd expect in a steadily growing economy. I combined the OMB's corporate profits forecast with its forecast for nominal gross domestic product to create an implied projection for the corporate profit share. By the end of 2023, the decline in the profit share will be bigger than anything observed since at least the early 1950s. It's not clear why firms would want to invest or hire workers if they believed these profit projections. Despite falling profits, the OMB's forecasters project higher receipts from corporate taxes -- implying, on the face of it, a big increase in the effective corporate tax rate. The closing of loopholes and new treatment of foreign earnings may have a bigger effect on earnings than investors are expecting. The Obama budget has one simple message: Shareholders, be warned.

Kerry has stepped in for President Barack Obama at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Bali after Obama canceled his trip to the region to seek an end to the Congressional impasse. “There are momentary disruptions and the momentary disruption always has the ability to have an impact,” Kerry told reporters in Bali today. “To all of our friends and foes watching around the world, let me be crystal clear: Do not mistake this momentary episode in American politics” as anything more than that. Obama’s decision to skip APEC may add to growing anxiety in Asia that the U.S. is too preoccupied with internal political challenges to pursue its so-called Asia pivot, Obama’s second-term foreign-policy priority to enhance U.S. standing in a region adjusting to China’s economic and military emergence. The U.S. is seeking to expand trade and defense ties in the region, especially by finalizing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact. APEC leaders gathering in Bali understand Obama’s decision and would have done the same if in his shoes, Kerry said. Obama had been presented a challenge “by a small group of people within one branch of the United States Congress.” “It is not only within Congress’s power to prevent the shutdown, it is also within Congress’s power to end it, to end it now, to end it today,” he said. Obama’s absence meant he could not hold planned meetings with the leaders of Russia and China , which undermined his agenda in the short term, Kerry said.

Former Autonomy executives, including ex-Chief Executive Officer Mike Lynch , have denied improper accounting and said today that they “look forward” to the FRC investigation. Deloitte LLC said in November that it didn’t find evidence of misrepresentations or improper accounting when it last audited Autonomy’s finances for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010. “Autonomy received unqualified audit reports throughout its life as a public company,” a spokeswoman for Autonomy’s former management said in a statement. “This includes the period in question during which Autonomy was audited by Deloitte.” Fully Cooperate Deloitte said it wasn’t hired to carry out due diligence on the Hewlett-Packard acquisition. “We intend to cooperate fully with the FRC’s investigation into these matters,” Deloitte said in a statement today. “We conducted our audit work in full compliance with regulation and professional standards.” The FRC will next decide whether to bring disciplinary proceedings against anyone responsible for accounting errors and the matter may ultimately be referred to a tribunal.

Even that may have overstated Deutsche Bank\\'s ability to absorb losses. The equity figure included 7.6 billion euros of deferred-tax assets, which would be worthless in a crisis. Thomas Hoenig, vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., has suggested that a reasonable ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets for banks would be 10 percent or more, excluding deferred taxes. After taking the new stock sale into account, Deutsche Bank trades for only about 61 percent of book value, which tells you investors still don\\'t trust the lender\\'s balance sheet. This is understandable. For example: Deutsche Bank said 32.8 billion euros of its financial assets as of March 31 were of the illiquid, hard-to-value \"Level 3\" variety, meaning \"the fair value cannot be determined directly by reference to market-observable information.\" That\\'s equivalent to a majority of Deutsche Bank\\'s equity. Deutsche Bank shouldn\\'t stop here: It should raise more equity -- a lot more. Let\\'s hope today\\'s rising shares will serve as encouragement. A safer, stronger bank is a more valuable one.

FIFA, soccer’s governing body, announced today on its website that Costa Rica ’s protest wasn’t filed properly and the game’s result would stand. Costa Rica’s soccer federation said after the March 22 contest that the weather jeopardized the integrity of the game. The group said today in a statement that it asking FIFA to reconsider its decision. Conditions at the stadium prevented Costa Rican soccer officials from filing the protest within the two-hour timeframe expected by FIFA, according to the statement. “We reviewed as best we could and compiled all the formal documentation, images and videos possible and this took time,” Jorge Hidalgo, the Costa Rican federation’s executive committee vice president, said in the statement, translated from Spanish. U.S. captain Clint Dempsey scored the only goal 16 minutes into the first half at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado. Snow fell steadily throughout the game, with groundskeepers shoveling the lines on the field during breaks in the play. A yellow ball was used for visibility. Today’s statement cited a clause in the 2014 FIFA World Cup regulations manual that says protests regarding the state of the field must be made “in writing to the referee before the start of the match.” If the field becomes unplayable during the game, the captain of the protesting team must immediately complain to the referee in the presence of the opposing captain, according to the rulebook. E-Mail Protest Following either of those protests, the complaint then needs to be confirmed in writing to FIFA “no later than two hours after the match,” according to the regulations. Costa Rican soccer officials failed to follow these rules, lodging their protest in an e-mail and fax two days after the game, FIFA said. The U.S., No. 33 in FIFA’s global rankings, is second in its World Cup qualifying group with three points through two games. Costa Rica, ranked No. 53, is last in the six-team group with one point.

(AAPL) ’s iPhones, predicts a shift in demand toward lower-priced smartphones will help boost royalty revenue. “There is a shift advantage for ARM as mid-range and entry smartphones drive smartphone growth. We’ve got that dynamic going into next year,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said at a conference in Barcelona yesterday. “Those phones generate much more royalty for ARM because they use more silicon.” ARM has had five consecutive years of revenue growth as its designs for chips that control graphics and processing were used in increasingly popular smartphones and tablets. Royalty payments took the spotlight last quarter as they missed analysts’ estimates. ARM shares have fallen almost 9 percent since the earnings report on Oct. 22. “As ARM technology becomes more sophisticated, the royalty percentage goes up,” Score said. “On average, it’s going to very gradually go up.” Global smartphone shipments surged 40 percent last quarter, slowing from 53 percent growth for the previous three-month period, according to researcher IDC. The average selling prices of the devices fell by 13 percent to $317 from a year earlier, because of demand for more affordable handsets. In spite of concerns about slowing growth, especially in China, Score said ARM can continue expanding its customer base and outperforming the semiconductor market in the next five years, driven by cheaper handsets, enterprise networking and micro-controllers. ARM shares fell less than 1 percent to 953.50 pence at 9:16 a.m. in London. New Chief Chief Executive Officer Simon Segars, who succeeded Warren East in July, is confronting a shift in the industry’s growth to low-end smartphones and new entrant Intel Corp.

(FB) to Google Inc. (GOOG) look for lower-power machines to drive their data centers. It’s “possible to identify such a market and build a chip specifically for that market, whether it is to handle only storage or only video loading, for example. We can make the chip much more efficient,” Score said at the annual Technology, Media and Telecoms Conference organized by Morgan Stanley. “Everyone knows Intel has a very strong ecosystem around servers, we’re not kidding ourselves,” Score said. “For that reason we see it as further out.”')\n",

ATP, which oversees $140 billion, has limited its government bond portfolio to Danish and German debt and in 2011 renegotiated contracts to avoid having to accept French bonds as collateral for funding. Europe ’s plan for a financial levy means Danish bonds will become the most attractive, said Anders Svennesen, deputy chief investment officer at Hilleroed, Denmark-based ATP. “A financial transactions tax could potentially make Danish bonds a good, cheaper proxy to bonds in Germany,” he said in a March 22 phone interview. The levy “will seriously hurt liquidity and make it much more costly to trade even German government bonds. Not only will the tax apply when buying or selling the underlying assets, but hedging the currency exposure along with it will also trigger a tax payment.” The European Union on Feb. 14 unveiled its proposal for a 0.1 percent tax for stock and bond trades and 0.01 percent on derivatives trades with ties to participating countries. The measure exempts primary offerings of government bonds. The EU estimates the move could raise 30 billion euros ($40 billion) to 35 billion euros a year. To become law, the proposal has to be approved by the countries that agree to participate, which comprise 11 nations including Germany, Spain and France. Spreads Widen Denmark has chosen not to join.

ATP, which had a return of 9.9 percent last year, held 430 billion kroner ($74 billion) in government bonds, according to its 2012 annual report. That portfolio was split 50-50 between German and Danish government bonds, according to Svennesen. “For non-FTT compliant investors looking to buy European exposure Danish assets will become relatively more attractive,” said Svennesen.

His departure follows a decision last year by Nomura to fold all execution services, including cash, program and electronic trading outside of Japan , into the firm’s Instinet unit, a standalone brokerage acquired in 2006. The Tokyo-based bank announced the move in September, while disclosing at the same time that it planned to eliminate $1 billion of costs by scaling back the firm’s global ambitions. Wells didn’t return a phone call seeking comment on his departure. Redzi Mangwana, a London-based spokeswoman for Nomura, declined to comment. Tripp Kyle, a spokesman for New York-based Millennium, declined to comment. Wells’ registration with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority as a Nomura employee has been inactive since June 13, according to the regulator’s website. He had worked at Lehman since 2001, according to the website. Program trading typically involves buying and selling baskets of securities through a computer algorithm based on preconditioned triggers. The strategy can be used to take advantage of situations when related securities and indexes trade outside their normal range. Millennium has been adding employees after almost tripling its assets under management to $18.2 billion since June 2010. The firm, founded in 1989 by former American Stock Exchange floor broker Israel Englander, allocates its capital to more than 140 trading teams focused on investing in stocks and bonds, according to its website.')\n",

Over time, we’ve come to think that anyone can do this sort of thing. But IT is hard. Conservatives who argue that this shows the government can never do IT right should remember that lots of companies can -- and do -- get IT wrong. We think the private sector is so good at it because we see only the winners who got it right. The many projects that went horribly wrong have slipped out of view, and memory. But liberals who have been proclaiming that the health exchange glitches will be fixed eventually because after all, Amazon does this, should remember that the end of every glitchy project is not a product that actually works. Horrifyingly bad launches, into which category I’d say the exchanges now fall, often end when the product is jerked out of production. More than occasionally, the company that made the product goes away.

EDF, the biggest European power generator, has set aside billions of euros to improve safety and keep reactors running for as long as six decades. While some models due to run for 30 years were given approval to operate an extra decade, President Francois Hollande has ordered the halt of EDF’s oldest plant at Fessenheim in a first step to cutting reliance on atomic power. While EDF’s program to extend the life of its reactors is “satisfactory,” it needs to be bolstered in some areas, the regulator said in a statement on its website. The demands for improved safety, beyond measures required after the Fukushima meltdown in Japan , seek to bring standards closer to those of newer nuclear models like the EPR, according to the regulator. The safety of spent fuel storage at current reactors doesn’t meet the level of new installations, it said. Under the regulatory system, the ASN carries out in-depth inspections of reactors every 10 years to determine whether they can function for another decade. This method will continue even as EDF seeks regulatory approval to replace equipment and carry out other work needed to enable reactors to run for 60 years. “We are a long way from making a decision” on a possible extension beyond 40 years, Pierre-Franck Chevet, head of the ASN, told a parliamentary hearing in Paris in April. “We are at the very beginning of a process.” The government is leading a debate on the nation’s energy mix.

Work on so-called autonomous vehicle systems will move from an R&D center in Japan to Sunnyvale, she said, declining to provide investment details for the project. “We’re going to focus on this technology really in the heart of where it lies today,” Bailo said in the Feb. 15 interview. “We are going to be shifting work that’s being done in our Nissan Advanced Technical Center in Atsugi, and moving that work over to the heart of the industry.” Automakers and companies including Google Inc. plan new electronics and programming for vehicles with a goal of reducing collisions, fuel use and improving traffic flow. Carlos Ghosn , Nissan’s chief executive officer, told reporters last month in Detroit that regulatory, legal and technological hurdles mean self-driving cars won’t be feasible until about 2020. Google has tested a self-driving Prius in California for years, and the U.S. Defense Department has sponsored autonomous- vehicle research for more than a decade. Nissan’s Sunnyvale center will work with automotive labs at Stanford University, the University of California’s Berkeley and Davis campuses, and Silicon Valley companies, Bailo said. The Yokohama-based carmaker plans to apply technology developed at the new R&D center within a decade, she said. Maarten Sierhuis , a former NASA scientist specializing in artificial intelligence research, will lead the Sunnyvale facility, Nissan said today. Toyota Motor Corp. opened its own Silicon Valley outpost in Mountain View in 2012 to work with technology companies there on in-car data and entertainment systems. The company said in January that it’s developing autonomous safety systems to create a virtual “co-pilot” in vehicles to help drivers avoid accidents rather than self-driving cars and trucks.')\n",

Although the euro area is its biggest trading partner, Switzerland has managed to avoid the recession that has befallen the neighboring bloc. “We consider that in a situation of normalization, the franc should depreciate,” he said. The SNB has seen its foreign-currency holdings balloon as a result of its campaign to defend the ceiling. Last year, it spent 188 billion francs ($198 billion) on foreign currencies, up 10 times from 2011. It holds nearly half of its reserves in euros.

The Doha-based carrier is in talks with Boeing for compensation, Al Baker said. Regulators around the world ordered airlines to stop flying the 787 after two battery faults that month caused a fire in one plane and forced an emergency landing by another.

Orange dropped for a second day in Paris after France’s smallest fixed operator unveiled a 15.99-euro ($22) monthly tariff for stripped-down broadband and telephone services. The move prompted questions on whether rivals will follow suit with fixed-line price cuts, and shows how French carriers are moving further apart in their strategies to win and retain customers. Orange will continue to compete for users who want cheaper options with its Sosh brand, Ernotte said. Orange has shifted focus in the past year back to its fixed-line business from mobile in its home market as price wars weigh on its wireless earnings. Discounts in France continue to cut into profits almost two years after Iliad SA (ILD) started selling mobile subscriptions starting at 2 euros. Bouygues Telecom, a unit of Bouygues SA (EN) , joined the low-cost fray, pulling some services out of its fixed packages under the B&You brand to cut in half the 30-euro average monthly market price for broadband, phone and Internet services grouped together. ‘We’re Covered’ Bouygues’s tariffs could cut Orange’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by about 110 million euros a year, Jefferies analysts projected yesterday. Orange is expected to generated 12.7 billion euros in 2013 Ebitda, which may drop to 12.2 billion euros in 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Orange is betting that it can attract customers and charge more by including innovative services such as a high-end TV remote control. To stop consumers from moving to discounters, the Paris-based company also started a separate brand called Sosh, which offers at cheaper prices. “We’re covered at both the high and the low ends of the spectrum,” Ernotte said. “The current agitation doesn’t change our perception of the market.” The shares slipped 0.5 percent to 9.70 euros at 10:53 a.m. in Paris, adding to yesterday’s 3.9 percent decline. They are still up 16 percent this year, valuing the company at 25.7 billion euros. Orange has predicted that pressure on its profits in France will gradually ease next year, helped by the spread of more expensive offers based on speedier Internet technologies -- 4G in mobile and fiber in fixed.

The rules were introduced more than a year ago after many banks suffered from an increase in bad loans linked to debt restructuring by GREs during Dubai’s property crash. “The new regulation by the central bank had been received positively by the markets because it protects the banking sector from another crisis,” said Montasser Khelifi, Dubai-based senior manager for global markets at Quantum Investment Bank Ltd. “Now that the banks are asking for a delay of five years, that means that the recovery is still not complete and that the risky exposures are still important in the banks’ balance sheets.” Dubai Islamic shares fell for the first time in nine days, trimming their advance this year to 68 percent.

That beat the $13.2 billion median estimate of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The better-than-anticipated figure was due to “precautionary” measures to ration the use of dollars, Nidal Assr, central bank sub-governor, said yesterday. Reserves have plunged 60 percent since the 2011 uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak as investors and tourists shunned the country. “The squeeze in NDFs is a product of people being happy we didn’t see a sharper drop in reserves,” Stephen Bailey-Smith, emerging markets strategist at Standard Bank Plc, said by phone. “There’s also a little more optimism about the potential of an IMF deal before the elections.” Economic Plan The government outlined an economic plan last week designed to help secure a $4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund , including raising taxes on some goods and gradually lifting fuel subsidies. The IMF agreement has been on hold since November amid a political crisis between the ruling Islamist regime of President Mohamed Mursi and opposition groups.

That review hinges on an analysis by Health Commissioner Nirav Shah, who is considering two outside studies: one by Danville, Pennsylvania-based Geisinger Health System on thousands of people who live near wells and another by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Shah said he won’t wait until those studies are complete to make a decision. The Senate bill would require him to do so. “I anticipate we’ll be done in the next few weeks,” Shah said today at press briefing. “We are learning more information as we go, and we want to make sure we cover all the ground and not rush through this.” The Senate bill was introduced March 5 by the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of five breakaway Democrats who share power with Republicans. The next day, the Democratic- controlled Assembly passed a separate measure that would create a two-year ban. Cuomo, a Democrat, said today he doesn’t believe the legislature will pass any ban. Fracking, in which water and chemicals are injected into shale formations to free trapped oil and gas, poses a dilemma for Cuomo, 55, who must balance prospects for the type of economic development seen in Ohio and Pennsylvania against environmentalists’ warnings that it may damage water supplies and make farmland unusable. Last month, Environmental Conservation Commissioner Joseph Martens said the state would begin issuing fracking permits before creating regulations if the Health Department says natural-gas drilling is safe. “We’re not looking for a political resolution,” Cuomo said. “We want a conclusion based on the science.”')\n",

It has an annual capacity of about 12 million tons of crude oil that’s exported to North America, Europe and Asia. Dong said the transaction is expected to result in a pretax loss of 150 million Danish kroner ($26.1 million). “With the divestment of Mongstad, we are taking another significant step towards the realization of our financial action plan,” Henrik Poulsen, chief executive officer at Dong, said in a statement. “We have now divested a total of approximately 9 billion Danish kroner of non-core activities.” Statoil spokesmen weren’t immediately available to comment on the transaction.')\n",

(LNKD) , the biggest online professional-networking service, forecast second-quarter sales that trailed analysts’ estimates, raising concern that efforts to boost mobile advertising will be slow to kick in. Revenue in the current period will be $342 million to $347 million, the Mountain View , California-based company said today in a statement. That missed the $359.7 million average analyst projection, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LinkedIn, founded a decade ago to connect recruiters and job seekers, is adding features and content to appeal to people who use the site from smartphones. The company revamped its mobile app and agreed last month to buy Pulse, a service that lets users access news on handheld devices. Still, mobile-ad revenue may not be rising on pace with the transition to wireless computing, said Aaron Kessler, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc. “It could be the desktop-to-mobile shift, and they don’t have as much advertising on mobile,” said Kessler, who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock and is based in San Francisco. LinkedIn’s ad business came in weaker than projected, Kessler said. LinkedIn shares dropped as much as 12 percent in extended trading. They had gained 3.5 percent to $201.67 at the close in New York. The stock has more than quadrupled since the company’s initial public offering almost two years ago. Estimate Shortfall The results come a day after Facebook Inc., the biggest social-networking site, reported revenue that beat analysts’ predictions, with its mobile business making up about 30 percent of ad sales. LinkedIn and Facebook, like many popular Web applications, are testing ways to make money from mobile ads. LinkedIn’s full-year sales forecast also trailed estimates. The company said 2013 revenue will be $1.43 billion to $1.46 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LinkedIn didn’t break out mobile revenue in its release. Total sales in the first quarter climbed 72 percent to $324.7 million from $188.5 million a year earlier, LinkedIn said in the statement.

LinkedIn’s biggest revenue generator is still its talent-solutions product, aimed at helping recruiters fill jobs. Sales in that unit jumped 80 percent to $184.3 million.

Going forward, air fares for its fleet of small planes will be based on weight—not just the weight of your luggage, but the weight of your own body. This kind of thing has been joked about for years, but now that it's a reality, is it actually a good idea? Why it's a good idea There is something to be said for the simplicity of this model. Just add up your weight and the weight of all your bags and you pay a flat price per pound (or in this case, kilogram). The price per kilo goes up the longer the flight. Seems simple, right? And when it comes to flying, weight is a huge cost component. The heavier the plane and everything in it, the more fuel required to fly it. So the airline is doing a good job of tying its revenues to its costs in using this kind of method. As a bonus, on smaller aircraft (the only kind Samoa flies), weight distribution is crucially important in order to make sure that the plane is balanced for flight. If you know everyone's weight in advance, you can spread it around before takeoff and make sure the plane isn't too heavy. Why it's a bad idea First of all, weight varies. You might go on a huge diet between the time you book and the time you fly. (Or you might eat a ton.) So what you purchased could be different than what you actually need. Not to mention that what you need might not be based on eating habits at all—some people are just naturally taller or bulkier, and their fee will reflect that. When it comes to bag weight, that's like asking someone if they want to eat chicken or beef at a wedding dinner…two months in advance. Who the heck knows? Oh yeah, and people lie about their weight all the time. That means that Samoa Air is still going to weigh everyone and everything at the airport. You'll have to pay the difference or get a refund if you've lost weight, I assume. That takes a lot of time to process at the airport and it's going to make travel more stressful. Of course, none of this even takes into account the social stigma of stepping on a scale in public. My wife won't even step on a scale with me in the room, so there will certainly be a lot of people who balk at this kind of handling in the middle of an airport. Every culture is different, however, and maybe Samoa Air thinks that its clientele will be perfectly okay with this plan. I think there is going to be quite the mixed reaction, especially if this strategy moves beyond the small market of Samoa. What do you think?

The chain distinguishes itself with a focus on budget-priced, healthy food and a predominance of own-brand items. “It was a discount store and it had high costs and it just proved too difficult to shift people from their traditional buying habits in big supercentres and supermarkets into a small store,” Tesco Chief Executive Officer Philip Clarke said in December, when the grocer first disclosed plans to exit the U.S. Bloomberg News reported on June 12 that Yucaipa was in talks to buy Fresh & Easy.')\n",

HARP previously was scheduled to expire at the end of 2013. The program allows borrowers to cut their loan payments by refinancing at lower interest rates even if they are stuck in homes that have lost value. More than 2.2 million borrowers have used the program so far. To qualify, homeowners must be current on their payments and have loans originated before June 1, 2009. HARP is “a useful tool for reducing risk,” FHFA Acting Director Edward J. DeMarco said in a statement. “We are extending the program so more underwater borrowers can benefit from lower interest rates.” The FHFA will soon begin a marketing campaign to expand the program’s reach, DeMarco said in the statement. There may be as many as 2 million eligible borrowers who haven’t taken advantage of HARP, according to analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. HARP loans began to surge last year and now account for almost a third of all refinancing applications, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Nearly 1.1 million borrowers used HARP last year alone, equaling the 1.1 million in the first three years of the program combined. FHFA data show that servicers are offering HARP loans to a growing number of the riskiest borrowers. About a quarter of HARP loans have gone to borrowers who owe more than their properties are worth. In January, nearly half of HARP refinancings were for such underwater borrowers. Higher Margins HARP has become more popular among lenders as margins shrink on traditional loans. HARP borrowers are less sensitive to higher rates and fees than homeowners who have other options. Also, securities containing HARP loans bring higher yields because borrowers are less likely to refinance again, preserving the value of the investment. President Barack Obama has made expanding the reach of HARP a centerpiece of his housing policy, calling for Congress in his Feb. 12 State of the Union address to pass a bill making the program more attractive to lenders. Senate Democrats Barbara Boxer of California and Robert Menendez of New Jersey introduced a bill in February that would implement the president’s request.')\n",

Boston-based NewStar rose 13 percent to $17.76 today, its highest since February 2007, giving the company a market value of about $863 million. Specialty lenders like NewStar, which makes loans to health-care, manufacturing and energy companies, typically charge higher interest rates, making them appealing targets for U.S. banks looking to increase profits. CapitalSource Inc. (CSE) , which also lends to businesses, agreed in July to sell to PacWest Bancorp (PACW) for $2.3 billion. “This company is a prime takeover target,” said Sameer Gokhale, an analyst who covers NewStar for Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. NewStar will appeal to regional banks interested in expanding in commercial lending, said Gokhale, who has a “neutral” rating on the stock and a price target of $17. Logical buyers include Jacksonville, Florida-based EverBank Financial Corp. (EVER) , Miami Lakes, Florida-based BankUnited Inc. (BKU) , and Wayzata, Minnesota-based TCF Financial Corp.

NewStar, with offices in nine U.S. cities, makes loans and leases of $5 million to $20 million to companies with annual sales of $25 million to $500 million, according to its annual report.

PacWest offered about 1.47 times CapitalSource’s book value, in the cash-and-stock takeover that was announced in July.

A decision isn’t expected before the planned April 16 deadline so the companies have agreed to extend the so-called long stop date for the acquisition to May 2. Glencore Chief Executive Officer Ivan Glasenberg is seeking to buy Xstrata to create the world’s fourth-largest mining company by adding coal, copper, nickel and zinc operations to its cotton-to-crude-oil trading empire. Gaining Chinese endorsement is the final hurdle for a takeover that after 14 months has won approval in Europe , Australia and South Africa. The combined company would be the world’s third-largest producer of mined copper, a metal used in pipes and wires. China’s Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, is responsible for the decision to sign off on the takeover.

Copper Market The Chinese regulator had focused its review on the new company’s influence in the copper-concentrate market, Glasenberg said March 6.

It’s up to the president to decide what happens now, he said. President Anibal Cavaco Silva, who has the power to dissolve parliament, called on the parties on July 10 to reach a “national salvation” agreement that will allow Portugal to complete its aid program through June 2014 and set early elections for after that date.

Mumbai-based Air India narrowed losses to 52 billion rupees ($952 million) in the year ended March from a record 75.6 billion rupees a year earlier, Singh said. The fuel-efficient 787 is key to attracting more passengers and cutting costs at Air India, which hasn’t made an annual profit since 2007. ANA Holdings Inc. (9202) , operator of the world’s largest 787 fleet, and Japan Airlines Co. will resume Dreamliner flights on June 1 as authorities approved fixes to battery overheating that grounded the plane’s global fleet. Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise and Qatar Airways Ltd. have already started 787 flights. United Continental Holdings Inc. plans to begin service on May 20. The planes were grounded after a Dreamliner operated by ANA made an emergency landing on Jan. 16 after detecting smoke from the battery. Nine days earlier, a battery had caught fire on a JAL 787 in Boston. No one was injured in either incident. Seek Compensation The carrier, which has six Dreamliners, will seek at least 2 billion rupees in compensation from Boeing for the losses caused by the grounding, a person familiar with the matter said last month. A ministry panel will initiate talks with Boeing for the compensation, Singh said, without giving details. Air India in 2005 ordered 68 passenger jets, including Dreamliners, worth about $8.1 billion to expand operations and introduce more fuel-efficient aircraft. The carrier has subsequently struggled with debts from the expansion plan, along with high fuel costs and price wars, which led to the government pledging 300 billion rupees in bailouts through 2020. The company plans to sell and lease back all of the 27 Dreamliners it has ordered as part of a financial turnaround plan. The jetliner is the world’s first made chiefly from composite materials and the first to use lithium-ion batteries. Air India will start using the Dreamliner on the New Delhi-Bangalore route from tomorrow. Battery fixes have been completed in two of the carrier’s six 787 aircraft, Singh said. Jet fuel discounts from state-run refiners and sale of real estate assets will help the carrier further narrow losses this year to 39.9 billion rupees, he said.

The illnesses killed about 50,000 people in 2010. About 16 percent of adults 60 and older are vaccinated against shingles. Rates aren’t much better for vaccination against human papillomavirus, which can cause cervical cancer in women and malignancies of the penis and anus in men. About 30 percent of women ages 19 to 26 have received the HPV vaccine and 2.1 percent of men in the same age group. The CDC is calling for greater public education about vaccines and for health-care providers to more frequently recommend them to patients. “Too few adults are taking advantage of protection from vaccines, leaving themselves and those around them at greater risk for vaccine-preventable diseases,” said Howard Koh, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC wants 60 percent of adults -- and 90 percent of those older than 65 -- to be vaccinated against pneumonia, said Carolyn Bridges, associate director for adult immunization at the agency. HPV Shots There was “little progress” in adult vaccine rates from 2010 to 2011, Bridges said, except for HPV.

Eighteen people died of the disease, most of them infants. About 13 percent of adults younger than 65 have received a combined vaccine for tetanus and pertussis, according to the CDC. “When the source is identified, four out of five babies who got whooping cough caught it from someone in their home,” Koh said today during a conference call.

An exhibition game in China “would be the first step, and it’s very possible if we’re growing the way we’re growing,” Young said. “Our fan base growth is on track.” Interest in American football is growing through the development of flag-football teams at 36 universities, online streaming of games through Sina.com (SINA) as well as promotional visits by former players, he said. Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana , who visited Shanghai with Young yesterday, said American football would probably become more popular if there were more Chinese-American athletes like Jeremy Lin, who has galvanized interest in the National Basketball Association through his play with the Houston Rockets. “If a Chinese player can come to the NFL, that would help the process move faster but I don’t think it’s a necessity,” Montana said in an interview from Shanghai. “Once they understand the game, they will love it like any other sport.” China may follow the example of Britain, which has moved from one exhibition game a year to hosting two sold-out regular-season games, Young said.

The Bank of Mongolia reduced its policy rate to 11.5 percent from the previous 12.5 percent effective April 8, according to a statement posted to its website today. The cut is aimed at increasing domestic credit and investments and stimulating business activities, it said. Mongolia in January cut interest rates for the first time since 2009 after economic expansion moderated to 12.3 percent last year from a record 17.3 percent in 2011 and foreign investment fell 17 percent. Growth slowed as the price of coal, Mongolia’s biggest export, declined and the government introduced more controls on foreign ownership of mining assets. A deceleration in the pace of inflation over the last four months and the monetary authority’s estimate for further slowing was the main reason for the cut, Sandagdorj Bold, the central bank’s chief economist, said in an interview in Ulaanbaatar today. Mongolian trade and foreign investment were also factors in the decision, he said. “We are concerned about the FDI and foreign trade environment.” Foreign investors have criticized steps by Mongolia’s government to increase controls over the mining industry. The Business Council of Mongolia, which counts Rio Tinto Group, Peabody Energy and General Electric Co. among its members, issued a letter in January criticizing amendments to mining laws proposed by President Tsakhia Elbegdorj, saying the changes would deter investment. The president’s proposal followed the passage of a law last year that made it more difficult for foreign companies to control strategic assets in Mongolia. Rio Tinto The Mongolian government and Rio Tinto, the nation’s biggest foreign investor, have also been at loggerheads over how to develop the $6.6 billion Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine. The two sides have spent much of this year sparring over cost overruns and management control. Inflation eased to 11.3 percent at the end of February from 14 percent at the end of December, Bold said. The central bank expects the pace to fall further this month, he said. “In upcoming months we think we will see downward inflation,” Bold said. “So it’s consistent with our target of eight percent inflation by the end of the year.”')\n",

AirAsia Group chief Executive Officer Tony Fernandes said by e-mail that he would comment “in due course.” ANA would continue operating the business as a low-cost carrier from Narita airport even if the partnership with AirAsia is dissolved, Tezuka said. AirAsia Japan has struggled to fill as many seats as low-cost carriers Peach Aviation Ltd., partly owned by ANA, and Jetstar Japan Co. , which also began flights in Japan last year. “ANA should be able to turn around the carrier,” said Ryota Himeno , an analyst at Barclays Securities Japan Ltd. “They’ve already shown they can be successful with Peach. AirAsia may have discovered the difficulties of flying from Narita,” rather than Japan’s downtown Haneda airport, he said. The Nikkei newspaper reported earlier today that ANA will acquire AirAsia’s stake in AirAsia Japan, without saying where it got the information. 33 Percent Stake ANA, which owns 67 percent of AirAsia Japan, may buy out AirAsia’s stake in the venture, Tezuka said. Narita, Japan-based AirAsia Japan filled 67.6 percent of seats on its domestic flights during Japan’s Golden Week holiday period from April 26 to May 6, the company said in a statement last month. In comparison Peach, which flies from Kansai airport in Osaka , Japan, filled 91.3 percent of its domestic seats, according to the company. Jetstar Japan, which only flies within the country and is also based in Narita, filled 78.8 percent of seats, according to the company. ANA has said that it aims to fill 80 percent or more of its seats on low-cost carrier operations. AirAsia Japan, which began operations in August, has five domestic services and also flies to Seoul and Busan in South Korea. The carrier will add flights to Taiwan next month and is considering another overseas flight before the end of March as it more than doubles its fleet to nine planes from four, Yoshinori Odagiri, chief executive officer of the carrier, said last week.

(JPM) was warned by U.S. energy-market authorities that they may take action against its employees as part of an inquiry into bidding practices, the New York Times said, citing a document it reviewed. Enforcement officials at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission plan to recommend the agency hold traders and commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters “individually liable,” the newspaper reported, citing a 70-page document the agency sent the New York-based bank in March. Investigators said Masters falsely denied awareness of problems, the Times said. The case focuses on eight “schemes” adopted by traders in Houston between September 2010 and June 2011, according to the newspaper. The traders offered energy at prices “calculated to falsely appear attractive,” prompting state authorities in California and Michigan to make about $83 million in “excessive” payments to JPMorgan, the Times cited investigators as saying. “The staff is challenging a bidding strategy that was transparent and was in full compliance with the applicable rules,” the Times quoted Kristin Lemkau , a spokeswoman for the bank, as saying. “We strongly disagree with the staff’s conclusions.” ‘Strongly Dispute’ JPMorgan intends to defend itself and the employees, she told the newspaper. “We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter.” Lemkau and Mary O’Driscoll, a spokeswoman for the FERC, declined to comment when reached by Bloomberg News. Congress expanded the agency’s enforcement authority in 2005, partially in response to trading by Enron Corp. employees that disrupted California’s energy markets earlier in that decade. Within the past two years, FERC has made public 13 inquiries into alleged market manipulation, including probes of trading units at Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc. Deutsche Bank agreed to a $1.6 million settlement Jan. 22, backing away from from a previous assertion that it was prepared to challenge fines in court. A unit of the bank, accused of making manipulative trades in early 2010, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, according to the commission. It’s unclear whether the FERC will file an action against JPMorgan, the Times said. The bank has until at least mid-May to respond to the accusations in the document, and a majority of the five-member commission must first back the case before claims may be brought. If the FERC proceeds, it could seek to fine the bank and Masters, according to the newspaper. While Masters was “less involved in the day-to-day decisions,” investigators said she got e-mails and presentations outlining the trading strategies, the publication reported, citing the document.')\n",

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he’ll pay his first official visit to Athens to discuss ways to help Greek businesses, as the German government rallied to the side of Greece. Schaeuble, in a statement released in Berlin one day after Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by phone with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, said that he’d accepted an invitation to the Greek capital from his “friend and colleague” Yannis Stournaras, Greece’s finance minister. His visit will come in weeks rather than months, and will include talks on measures such as the creation of a state-owned development bank that would disburse German loans, the Finance Ministry said. “Greece still has a steep and long path of reforms ahead of it,” Schaeuble said in the statement e-mailed today. “The troika and the countries of Europe will continue to closely support and assist the Greek partners.” Germany ’s coordinated show of support may bolster Samaras after he overrode objections from his coalition partners and shut public broadcaster ERT on June 11, eliminating 2,600 jobs and prompting a public outcry. Merkel, who in October made her first visit to Athens during the three-year sovereign debt crisis, told Samaras of her “respect” and “support for the clear reform orientation” of Greece’s government, her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said in a statement yesterday. Samaras’s coalition of New Democracy, Pasok and Democratic Left “has succeeded at steering the Greek ship safely through most difficult waters and has already mastered a good part of the reform path,” Schaeuble said. “For this, we pay our respects to the Greek people and the Greek government.” The Greek government’s commitment to reducing the state payroll by 15,000 people by the end of next year has been a sticking point in past reviews by its creditors of Greece’s performance in meeting its bailout terms. “Now it is crucial to implement all agreements with the troika” of International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank, “including those referring to a reformed civil service,” Seibert said.')\n",

In a report published today in the journal Nature, researchers at Stanford University described the method that replaced fats in the brain of mice with a gel that made the organ transparent. The scientists were able to make images of the brain’s structures and see down to the cells and molecules, according to the paper. The approach also was used on a human brain, the report said. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama announced the BRAIN Initiative, which will spend $100 million beginning in 2014 to map the complex interactions between neurons. The new technique may aid the research, allowing long-range circuits to be more easily mapped, said Michelle Freund, of the National Institute of Mental Health. “The BRAIN Initiative recently announced by the White House is designed to facilitate innovative strategies to better understand the brain,” Freund said in a video released by the institute. “In order to do that, we need new technologies, and clarity is a great example of the type of technologies that will enable future brain studies.” Previous methods required scientists to slice brains into small sections to look at anatomy. This slicing deformed the organs and made it difficult for researchers to see large-scale information running across the slices. Fat Replacement The researchers at Stanford near Palo Alto, California , replaced the fats that support the brain’s cells with a clear material that held all the delicate systems in place. First, the brains were soaked in a chemical bath and then heated, creating a clear gel in place of the fats. That allowed the scientists more access to the whole brains. The team tested the technique, dubbed Clarity, on the brain of a mouse that had been genetically tweaked to produce a fluorescent protein. Under an electron microscope, the scientists were able to see even the spaces between the neurons. What’s more, the researchers tested Clarity on the brain of an autistic person that had been preserved in formaldehyde for six years. There too, scientists saw individual nerve fibers. Since many brains have been preserved in formaldehyde for years, those organs stored in libraries may also be studied.')\n",

Grayling, who starts a consultation process on rehabilitation today, said mentors will be at the heart of his approach. All offenders, including those serving less than 12 months, will be subject to monitoring and individual rehabilitation on release. “What we do at the moment is send people out of prison with 46 pounds ($74) in their pocket, and no support at all,” Grayling said in an e-mailed statement. “No wonder we have such high levels of reoffending. It is madness to carry on with the same old system and hope for a different result.” While the public sector will handle the most dangerous and high-risk offenders, private and voluntary organizations will be asked to close what the government calls the “revolving door” of the criminal justice system by dealing with lower-risk criminals. Almost half of all prison-leavers are reconvicted within 12 months, and that figure rises to almost 58 percent for those serving less than a year, according to the Justice Ministry. Half a million crimes are committed by convicted criminals each year. Private providers will only be paid in full if they reduce reoffending in their area. To support the proposed changes, the government plans to set up a nationwide “Justice Data Lab.” Organizations working to rehabilitate offenders at a local level will have access to “high-quality reoffending data specific to the group of offenders they have been working with,” the ministry said. “This will allow them to focus only on what works, better demonstrate their effectiveness and ultimately cut crime in their area.”')\n",

The U.K. central bank this month embraced so-called forward guidance by projecting it will keep its benchmark rate at 0.5 percent until late 2016 as it waits for the jobless rate to fall from 7.8 percent. That hasn’t stopped investors from pushing up U.K. gilt yields as a strengthening economy raises questions over whether the central bank will hold out so long. “The knowledge that monetary policy will not be tightened until the U.K.’s fledgling recovery is secured should boost confidence,” Bean said. “Moreover, it should reduce the likelihood that the present expansionary monetary stance is withdrawn prematurely through an upward movement in market interest rates.” Bean said such forward guidance and good communications alone won’t be enough to guarantee the exit from easy monetary policy will be smooth. That’s because even when a central bank’s intent is well understood, market rates respond to economic data rather than wait for policy makers to act. ‘Imperfectly Predictable’ “Although there are benefits to the market more accurately anticipating a given policy decision, because the data are likely to evolve in an imperfectly predictable fashion, so will market interest rates and asset prices,” Bean said. The 10-year gilt yield was little changed to end the week at 2.71 percent. The price of the 1.75 percent security due in September 2022 was 92.375. The rate climbed to 2.76 percent on Aug. 22, the highest since Aug. 8, 2011. U.K. government bonds lost 4 percent in the past three months through Aug. 22. They underperformed Treasuries’ 3.4 percent decline and German securities, which slid 2.3 percent, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Bean pushed back against suggestions that policy makers need to be more coordinated globally to reduce international fallout from their decisions, saying acting in concert was not a “viable option.” “The best we can probably aspire to is directing monetary policies to achieving domestic price stability in a sensible manner and seeking to communicate our policy intentions as clearly as possible,” he said.')\n",

Even so, the offering was seven times oversubscribed. Testifying on the IPO to Parliament’s Business Committee in London today, Cable said he was looking to “place the shares with long-term investors.” He rejected suggestions from lawmakers that the popularity of the offering meant the price had been set too low or that ministers should consider a windfall tax on any property sales the privatized company might make. The popularity of the offering means share orders priced below the maximum 330 pence risk missing out, two people familiar with the sale process said yesterday. The stock, set to raise 1.7 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) for the government, may gain 20 percent once trading starts, according to so-called gray market prices. Looking at previously oversubscribed offerings, Cable said, “the trajectory of their subsequent share values has been very, very disparate -- some have gone down.” Royal Mail’s privatization will be the biggest in the U.K. since British Rail was broken up in the 1990s.

The Anaheim, California-based company listed assets of as much as $500 million and debt of as much as $1 billion in a Chapter 11 petition filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Assets include a shuttered General Motors Co. factory in Wilmington that Fisker had planned to reopen. Safety recalls, a battery supplier that went bankrupt and shipments lost to Hurricane Sandy all contributed to the company’s financial woes, Henrik Fisker, the auto designer who co-founded the company, told Congress in a hearing April 24. A House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee scrutinized a $529 million federal loan granted to Fisker in 2009, questioning why the government had made it in the first place and what the company would do to repay taxpayers. Fisker missed its first payment on the low-interest U.S. loan on April 22. It had drawn about $193 million of the loan before being cut off by the U.S. Energy Department for missing milestones. Assembly Halted Founded in 2007, the closely held company halted assembly of its Karma sedans last year when the supplier of its lithium-ion batteries, A123 Systems Inc., filed for bankruptcy. Fisker sought a claim of $140 million in A123’s bankruptcy, and has said the company, since renamed B456 Systems Inc., supplied it with a defective product. In April, B456 got approval of a settlement with Fisker reducing the claim to $15 million. The Energy Department, which was criticized over loan guarantees to failed solar-panel maker Solyndra LLC, gave Fisker a loan primarily so it could acquire and restart production at the closed GM plant in Delaware.

RT @TheStalwart : Why aren’t physical receipts always opt-in?\" As it happens, there’s an easy answer to this question: Because except in a few places (such as taxi cabs and hotels), the receipts aren’t mostly for you. They’re for the employer. Ask yourself: Why does Banana Republic give you a receipt? Are you going to deduct your new sweater? Charge it to your employer? Are you unaware how much you just paid three seconds ago? Are you going to go home and laboriously enter your purchases in a ledger kept for just this purpose? No, no, no and no, in most cases. So why do they give you a receipt? And it\\'s not necessarily for returns. Instead, it\\'s mostly so employees can’t steal. The history of the cash register is, by and large, the history of theft prevention. Oh, they were originally created as tallying machines for very high-volume businesses. But it was hard to convince businesses that they needed to spend $150 or $200 on a machine to hold cash, at a time when a good workman might earn a dollar or two a day. The great innovation of the National Cash Register company was to market registers not so much as adding machines but as devices for preventing theft. Here’s Walter Friedman’s \" Birth of a Salesman \" on how these machines were made ubiquitous: That’s why cash registers ring loudly when the cash drawer opens -- so that a clerk with decent mental arithmetic skills can’t pretend to register your sale and then pocket the cash. And that’s why you get a physical receipt -- so that the clerk can’t ring up part of your sale, and then siphon the rest into his own pocket. They give you a receipt every time, annoying as it is, because they know you’ll glance at the total and notice if it’s very different from what you just paid. And maybe ask the clerk why, in the hearing of their manager.')\n",

It is rarely performed outside Russia. Berlin’s Staatsoper has revived it in a new, smart staging by the Russian director Dmitri Tcherniakov. The search for the bride becomes a television casting show and the prize is a virtual bachelor tsar assembled in computer images flashed onto a screen. He’s a digital composite -- a dash of Peter the Great, a smidgeon of Boris Yeltsin , a smattering of Leon Trotsky -- who ends up looking like Stalin. The sham beauty contest is conceived in an Internet chat room. Close-up projected images of the blushing young finalists slide across the stage. Marfa, who wins the contest just as she has taken that poison, becomes the victim of a modern celebrity cult which won’t allow her to peacefully marry her childhood sweetheart and lead a life of bourgeois contentment. The tsar only makes a brief personal appearance to stare piercingly at Marfa in the libretto, so Tcherniakov’s treatment works. The emotional entanglement revolves around one of his aides, Grigory Gryaznoy, who is violently in love with Marfa. Woman Scorned The dynamic baritone Johannes Martin Kraenzle plays him as a TV mover-and-shaker in denial about his fading appeal to young women. Olga Peretyatko sings Marfa with girlish vivacity. She can’t really compete with Anita Rachvelishvili as the scorned Lyubasha -- a more complex and interesting character. Rachvelishvili inspires pity, admiration and fear simultaneously and she earned the most enthusiastic applause of the evening. When she confronts Gryaznoy after a dinner party, her humiliation is excruciating. As she paws at his chest, he leans away to examine his drink. Tcherniakov’s directing is not just about clever concepts - - it is also rich in detail and meticulous in character analysis. Gestures chime perfectly with the libretto. He designed the unshowy, intelligent sets too -- a modern TV studio and conference room. A large window overlooking the street gains poetry with lush projections of autumn leaves. Pace and drama are supplied in spades by Daniel Barenboim and the Staatskapelle orchestra, with a vibrant, varied performance. Rating: *****.

Detroit’s emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, was asked in a Sept. 16 deposition whether he was considering using cash from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department “to fund existing obligations rather than new capital improvements,” according to a transcript filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Detroit. “We have examined a number of options and alternatives related to DWSD including those that might be implicated by your question,” Orr said. “I didn’t say that we would take any capital. I said we will -- we would consider it.” Detroit filed the largest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy in July, listing debt of about $18 billion. The city has about $5.4 billion worth of water and sewer bonds that Orr has said would be paid in full. Creditors seeking a share of Detroit’s remaining cash may seek to nullify the bankruptcy by arguing the city isn’t really insolvent because it has access to more money than it claims, such as the water and sewer revenue. The deposition was filed by unions and retirees challenging the city’s eligibility for federal bankruptcy court protection. “Mr. Orr was responding to a hypothetical posed by an attorney representing city retirees and not elucidating on a plan currently under consideration,” Bill Nowling, a spokesman for Orr, said in an e-mail. Possible Obstacle Orr also said in the deposition that restrictions in bond instruments or previous rulings from the bankruptcy judge may bar him from using water and sewer repair funds for anything else. Separately, Fitch Ratings said in a report today that it expects Detroit to default on its general-obligation bonds on Oct. 1. The New York-based ratings company already cut the Motor City’s pension-obligation certificates to D in June after Orr announced it would miss a $39.7 million payment. A grade of D signals a failure to pay debt service. “Detroit’s landmark bankruptcy sets the stage to confirm or challenge basic premises underlying municipal debt credit ratings,” Amy Laskey, a Fitch managing director, said in the report. If Detroit’s case lumps general-obligation bonds with post-employment benefit payments, Fitch may “reconsider” municipal grades broadly, according to the statement. Fitch said there’s “substantial protection” for the city’s water and sewer debt. The case is City of Detroit, 13-bk-53846, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).')\n",

The letter was obtained by Bloomberg. “By insisting that the company retain the ability to issue preferred shares -- for whatever purpose -- without a shareholder vote, you undermine shareholders’ rights,” Nathan Cummings Foundation Chief Executive Officer Simon Greer wrote in the letter.

New York-based DTCC, operator of a rival database, has said it might sue the CFTC if the CME’s proposal was approved. “For all swaps cleared by the clearing house, and resulting positions, the clearing house shall report creation and continuation data to CME’s swap data repository for purposes of complying with applicable CFTC rules governing the regulatory reporting of swaps,” the CFTC said yesterday in a statement. Dodd-Frank, the 2010 regulatory overhaul, gave the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission authority to write rules requiring swap data to be reported to the agencies and the public. The law, enacted in response to the 2008 credit crisis, set up so-called swap data repositories as record-keepers for information about buyers and sellers, volume and prices. “We are very pleased with the CFTC’s approval of our rule, which provides clarity on the issue and certainty for market participants,” Michael Shore , a CME Group spokesman, said in an e-mail. “We are eager to continue clearing swaps and reporting cleared swaps in the most efficient way.” The DTCC has said the CME plan fails to comply with more than a year of CFTC rulemaking and would lead to worse oversight of the market because data will be fragmented. ‘Cripple’ Choice The CME rule “will cripple market participant choice, is anti-competitive and compromises regulators and market participants’ ability to understand, assess and manage systemic risk effectively,” Larry Thompson, DTCC’s general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. He said DTCC and other market participants are considering their possible responses. JPMorgan in a Jan. 11 letter to the CFTC said the CME proposal is an anticompetitive arrangement between clearing and data record-keeping.

The company may get a “special treatment” designation and investors should be aware of risks, China Cosco said in a filing to Shanghai stock exchange on Jan. 25, without specifying the amount of the loss. The Tianjin, China-based company posted a net loss of 4.87 billion yuan ($782 million) in the first half of 2012 and a loss of 10.5 billion yuan in 2011. China Cosco is expected to have a 6.5 billion yuan net loss for 2012, based on the average of eight analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The shipping company is contending with higher fuel costs and slumping freight rates because of worldwide overcapacity. The Baltic-Dry Index, a measure of global commodity-shipping rates, slumped to a 25-year low last year, prompting Korea line Corp. (005880) and Sanko Steamship Co. of Japan to seek court protection. Rising Debt “We see little reason to be positive in the shares,” Barclays Plc analysts Jon Windham and Esme Pau wrote in a note dated Jan. 27. “The declining equity base and rising debt burden will need to be addressed in 2013.” The analysts maintained an underweight rating on the Hong Kong-traded stock with a target price of HK$3.32. China Cosco’s Shanghai-traded shares rose 0.5 percent to close at 4.34 yuan as the city’s benchmark Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index jumped 2.4 percent today. The daily trading limit for companies with a “special treatment” designation will be cut to 5 percent from 10 percent, according to rules posted by the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Companies that post annual losses for two consecutive years get that designation. If China Cosco posts another loss this year, the company’s A-shares may run the risk of being suspended from trading in Shanghai and also face the possibility of getting delisted, according to Citigroup Inc. analyst Vivian Tao.

National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer were responding to some congressional Democrats who urged Obama to extend the federal debt ceiling without congressional authorization under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Hours into a partial government shutdown resulting from a fiscal stalemate with House Republicans, administration officials and lawmakers are looking ahead to an Oct. 17 deadline for Congress to raise the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, told reporters at the Capitol today that invoking the president’s powers under the 14th Amendment to raise the limit is “an option that should seriously be considered.” House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said last week that she disagrees with Obama’s decision not to act unilaterally during a 2011 standoff over increasing the debt limit. “I would never have taken it off the table,” the California Democrat said. White House lawyers don’t see that as an option, Sperling and Pfeiffer said today at a Bloomberg Government luncheon. “Our folks have never found that there was such extraordinary authority,” Sperling said. Not Practical Pfeiffer said employing such a tactic is impractical. “Would people buy bonds that are legally questionable?” he said. “If you were buying a car, would you ever buy a car when the title was in doubt? The answer to that question is no.” “I don’t know why we would assume that investors would buy bonds that are legally in question, that could at any day be invalidated by a court,” he said. “So it is an impractical solution to the problem.” Proponents cite the language of the 14th amendment, which says that the “validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payments of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.” Obama and his advisers have consistently rejected using the amendment to justify raising the debt ceiling without Congressional support. “This is ultimately about whether the rest of the world, global investors, have confidence in this,” Sperling said. “The spectacle of auctions going off that are under a legal cloud would most likely have a lot of the same negative impact globally that people fear in an all-out default.”')\n",

(MSCI) after the country’s stocks plunged 91 percent since 2007. The MSCI Greece Index will no longer be classified as a developed market as it failed to meet criteria regarding securities borrowing and lending facilities, short selling and transferability, New York-based MSCI, whose equity indexes are tracked by investors with about $7 trillion in assets, said in a statement. The gauge consists of two companies , Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA, the country’s largest phone operator, and Opap SA, Greece’s biggest gambling firm. Locked out of bond markets since April 2010, Greece was forced to accept two European Union-led bailout packages as public opposition to pension and wage cuts derailed the pace of promised economic reforms. The benchmark ASE Index (ASE) , which has 60 members, sank 83 percent since October 2007. MSCI put Greece under review for downgrade in June 2012, saying restrictions on in-kind transfers, off-exchange transactions, stock lending and short-selling stopped Greece from having a fully functional market. The probability of a demotion increased after Coca-Cola HBC AG, which previously made up almost a quarter of the Athens Stock Exchange by weight, switched its primary listing to London in April. The index provider upgraded Greece to developed-market status in 2001. Downgrades could lead investors who follow MSCI’s gauges to sell the nations’ equities. The weight of Greek companies in the MSCI World Index has tumbled to 0.01 percent from 0.16 percent in May 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Depa Blow MSCI’s reclassification of Greece follows Russell Investments, which advises funds with $2.4 trillion in assets. Russell said in March it will downgrade Greece to an emerging from a developed market after it failed economic and operational-risk assessments. The benchmark ASE has fallen 9.2 percent this week as Greece failed to win any bids in a sale of the country’s gas monopoly. The unsuccessful attempt to sell Depa SA dented Greece’s state-asset sales program, which underpins 240 billion euros ($318 billion) of bailout loans from the euro area and International Monetary Fund.

Their specific roles haven’t been determined, she said. Manual flying skills and cockpit teamwork are part of the U.S. probe into the crash of Asiana Flight 214, which struck a seawall short of the San Francisco airport on July 6, killing three people. Lee Kang Kuk was in control of the Boeing Co. 777 plane and was being trained by Lee Jung Min on the flight. More than 300 people survived the crash, the first fatal airline accident in the U.S. since 2009. Spokeswoman Lee declined to comment on whether the two pilots will resume flying in the future. Asiana fell 0.8 percent to 5,000 won in Seoul trading. The stock has fallen 19 percent this year, compared with a 0.1 percent climb in South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index. Lee Kang Kuk, 46, logged 9,793 flight hours before the accident. Only 43 were on the 777, after he moved up from the narrow-body Boeing 737 , and he was making his first trip to San Francisco on the wide-body aircraft. Lee Jung Min, 49, a Korea Aerospace University graduate who joined Asiana in 1996, had flown 12,387 hours, including 3,220 on the 777. Two other pilots on Flight 214 returned to flying last month, spokeswoman Lee said. Safety Standards Asiana, South Korea’s second-biggest airline, plans to expand instruction for air crew and begin an outside review of safety standards, it said last month. Pilots will get more hours in flight simulators to prepare for approaches to airports without landing guidance systems. The carrier said it will also hire another company to evaluate its procedures, add safety specialists and boost maintenance. Lee Kang Kuk was using a visual approach the day of the accident because the instrument landing system’s glide slope, which helps line up the correct path to the runway, was closed for construction. Former Asiana pilots and trainers have said in interviews that the company’s pilots were well trained on automatic systems, yet rarely flew manually.

The company said today that two manufacturers have FDA approval to produce generic Suboxone tablets in the U.S. Competition could arrive within a month, according to Alex Howson, an analyst at Jefferies International in London. Reckitt Benckiser shares fell as much as 4.4 percent, also hurt by the FDA’s rejection in a Feb. 22 letter of the company’s September petition asking that makers of similar medicines implement more safeguards. The FDA also asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into claims by generic drug makers of anti- competitive business practices on Reckitt Benckiser’s part. The shadow of competition to Suboxone has hung over the Slough, England-based company since it lost U.S. patent protection in 2009. The pharmaceuticals unit generated 21 percent of profit last year, and analysts today reduced their 2013 profit estimates by as much as 4 percent. “The market has been waiting for this news since October 2009, when Suboxone’s orphan drug status lapsed,” Deutsche Bank AG analyst Harold Thompson said in a note today. “The tougher and longer-term impact will be to know how current film users react, with cash payers the most open to switch.” Generic Competitors Reckitt Benckiser, which said it was “disappointed” by the rejection of its petition, has said generics would eliminate as much as 90 percent of tablet sales and up to 20 percent of the newer film-strip version, which dissolves under the tongue and has captured a 64 percent volume share in the U.S. One of the generics will come from Bridgewater, New Jersey- based Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said in a statement today that is has received FDA approval for a generic version of Suboxone tablets, to be available in March.

Two legal appeals remain after the company won 13 previous challenges, Vice President Dennis Duffy said today at the American Wind Energy Association’s Offshore Windpower 2013 conference in Providence, Rhode Island. Cape Wind, based in Boston , has spent more than a decade pursuing the $2.6 billion project in Nantucket Sound, fighting opposition from environmental groups, local fishermen and members of the Kennedy family. It must begin construction by Dec. 31 to earn the federal investment tax credit. “What we are focusing on right now is ensuring we qualify for the ITC before the end of the year,” Duffy said in a speech. “We are waiting for those decisions and we think we’ll have them this fall,” Duffy said. “That will give us the opportunity to get the notice to proceed to get the project really going.” The 468 megawatt project has the backing of Danish investor PensionDanmark A/S, which committed $200 million in June, conditional on construction beginning this year. Efforts to arrange other equity commitments are “underway,” Duffy said. National Grid Plc (NG/) and Northeast Utilities (NU) ’ Nstar unit have agreed to buy most of the power. Anticipated Rulings Cape Wind will probably be able to move forward before the end of the year, said Michael Ernst, director of regulatory affairs at Tetra Tech Inc. (TTEK) , a Pasadena, California-based construction and engineering company. “The decisions should be out this fall,” and the judges are probably writing their rulings now, he said in an interview. Opponents doubt that Cape Wind will meet the deadline. “With the looming tax credit expiry, the whole house of cards will begin tumbling down,” Audra Parker, director of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, said in a phone interview. “Time is running out.” The ITC provides a 30 percent tax credit for eligible renewable-energy projects. Cape Wind already has state and federal permits. Cape Wind may spur additional U.S. offshore wind projects, said Sebastian Chivers, senior vice president at the renewable energy-consulting company TUV SUD PMSS, a unit of the Munich-based technical services provider TUV SUD AG. “I’m convinced there will be a booming offshore wind market in the U.S.,” he said in an interview.

The U.S., whose factory power costs are less than half those in the EU and Japan, may get a “slight increase” in the share of exports from industries including chemicals, aluminum and cement, according to the IEA ’s World Energy Outlook 2013. That’s the “clearest indication” of the link between low energy prices and the outlook for industry, the IEA said. Energy-intensive industries account for about a quarter of industrial employment and 70 percent of industrial energy use, the Paris-based adviser to 28 nations said in the report. Disparities in regional energy prices will influence investment decisions and company strategies, according to the IEA. “Unlike crude oil prices , which are relatively uniform worldwide, prices of other fuels have become subject to significant regional variations,” the IEA said. “Although gas price differentials have come down from the extraordinary levels seen in mid-2012, natural gas in the U.S. still trades at one-third of import prices to Europe and one-fifth of those to Japan.” Exports from Asia will advance as demand and consumption surges in that region, according to the IEA. Chinese manufacturers pay almost twice as much as U.S. factories for power, the agency said. Supply Contracts Europe can respond to the risk of losing exports by boosting energy efficiency , increasing domestic gas output and ensuring its energy subsidies aren’t too generous, Fatih Birol , the chief economist at the IEA, told reporters today at a press conference in London. Gas-supply contracts linked to oil can also be renegotiated to cut costs as suppliers will probably have decreasing influence over prices, Birol said. It’s becoming a “market for buyers,” he said.

Trade representatives for both sides signed off on the final 1,000-page accord under which the EU will eliminate “virtually all” tariffs on imports from Singapore over five years and the Asian nation will end duties on the few remaining goods such as beer from the 28-nation bloc that aren't already duty-free. EU duties on petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals from Singapore are among the levies to be scrapped. The deal, struck last December after almost three years of talks, will also scale back technical barriers to trade and anchor deregulation of services markets including banking and insurance. The EU’s chief negotiator, Rupert Schlegelmilch, and his Singapore counterpart, Keith Tan, released the document today in Singapore, according to the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm. This is “one of the most comprehensive free-trade agreements ever negotiated,” the commission said today in a statement in Brussels. In Europe , the accord still needs the approval of the EU’s national governments and the European Parliament before it can take effect, a process that may take another 15 months or so. The EU is sidestepping stalled World Trade Organization efforts to open markets by seeking commerce deals with individual countries such as the U.S., Canada and Japan or with groups of nations. The EU and Singapore had trade in goods of 52 billion euros ($70 billion) in 2012 and in services of 28 billion euros in 2011, making Singapore “by far” the bloc’s most important commercial partner in Southeast Asia , according to the commission. With the EU also negotiating free-trade agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand , the accord with Singapore “has the potential to lay the ground for the EU to engage with the region as a whole,” said the commission.\")\n",

Terkper is struggling to rein in a budget gap that reached 12 percent of gross domestic product last year, more than double the government’s target, as pre-election spending soared. The minister will probably project a shortfall for 2014 of about 6 percent to 7 percent, said Angus Downie, head of economic research at Ecobank Transnational Inc. in London , who estimates a deficit of 10 percent for this year. Ghana’s cedi has slumped 15 percent against the dollar this year as gold prices fell and the government’s wage bill ballooned, putting pressure on the budget deficit. Terkper, who is scheduled to give his budget speech at about 10 a.m. local time, began reducing fuel subsidies and raising some taxes to help boost tax revenue in Africa ’s second-largest gold producer. Lawmakers on Nov. 15 increased the value-added tax rate to 15 percent from 12.5 percent to raise funding for infrastructure.  “Revenue mobilization and widening the tax base is crucial if pressure on spending is to be alleviated,” Downie said in an e-mailed response to questions. “The removal of fuel prices subsidies shows that the government is able to take fiscally responsible decisions that have long-term benefits for the economy.” Spending on wages has climbed to 72 percent of tax revenue following an 18 percent salary increase for state workers last year. The state plans to lower the wage bill to between 30 percent and 35 percent of tax income by 2015. Gold Slump Fitch Ratings last month lowered Ghana’s credit rating to B from B+ as the government failed to achieve its fiscal deficit goal of 9 percent for this year and overran spending on interest payments and arrears. The cedi, the third-worst performing actively traded African currency thats actively traded this year after South Africa’s rand and Malawi’s kwacha, gained 1.4 percent against the dollar to 2.2340 as of 3:42 p.m. in Accra on Nov. 15.

(2768) said it will import Ukrainian soybeans for the first time as Asia’s second- largest buyer looks outside North America for non-genetically modified produce. Sojitz will deliver a trial “few hundred” metric tons this year and expand that to 5,000 tons within three years, Fukutaro Kobayashi, deputy chief of one of the food departments at the Tokyo-based trader, said in an interview yesterday. U.S. and Canadian farmers are increasingly raising genetically modified crops, with GM soybeans accounting for 93 percent of the U.S. total last year, according the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Supply from the U.S. and Canada made up 92 percent of Japan’s imports in 2011, according to Finance Ministry data. “If we ask ourselves: Will be we able to secure supply of non-GM soybeans in North America year-in year-out? The answer’s no,” Kobayashi said. “We need to diversify our geography of supply.” While Japan doesn’t ban GM oilseeds, consumer preferences mean that these are only used in cooking oil and sweeteners, which aren’t required by law to notify buyers about their use. Japan used more than 950,000 tons of soybeans last year for foods such as tofu, miso soup paste and natto, stringy beans eaten for breakfast. Of that, about 80 percent of demand was met with imports, according to the agriculture ministry. Longer Wait Sojitz may sell Ukrainian soybeans at a 10 percent discount to the North American equivalent as a way to attract buyers in Japan, Kobayashi said. The transport of soybeans from Ukraine’s Odessa port to Japan takes about three weeks, compared with a week from the U.S., he said. Ukraine was forecast to produce as much as 2.33 million tons of soybeans last year, according to Kiev-based ProAgro. The U.S. and Brazil , the world’s largest producers, are forecast by the USDA to produce 83.5 million and 82.1 million tons in the marketing year that began Oct. 1. In 2010, Sojitz joined with Soyko International Inc. and Grain Alliance , a Ukrainian farm operator and grain elevator, to secure local supplies, Kobayashi said. The Ukrainian firm owns 40,000 hectares of land, most of which is cultivated, and drying and storage facilities with a capacity of 80,000 tons, according to its website. The venture with Grain Alliance in Ukraine, a newcomer to soybean cultivation, will produce about 3,000 tons of the oilseed for use in food this year, Kobayashi said. “We’ve been sending trial samples to food producers and the reception has been favorable,” Kobayashi said. While producers prefer North American soybeans, cheaper supplies from Ukraine will win market share in Japan, he said.')\n",

Exports may be about 17 million tons in the year ending March 31, said the industry group’s Secretary General R.K. Sharma. That’s the lowest since at least fiscal 1999, according to Sharma and government data. In September, Goa, the nation’s biggest exporter, banned all mining after a government panel said the state’s exchequer lost an estimated 349.4 billion rupees ($6.5 billion) because of illegal mining. The nation’s top court extended the halt in October. About 127 million tons of iron ore was mined illegally between 2006 and 2011, the panel, headed by former Judge M.B.

Higher taxes and freight charges on iron ore also impeded shipments, said Sharma. The export levy was increased to 30 percent in December 2011 on all grades of ore from 20 percent, while the railways increased freight charges to ports by as much as four times to encourage local supplies. “Shipments have been abysmal and this trend is likely to continue unless freight and taxes on iron ore meant for exports are reduced,” Sharma said.

That “would appear to be low for an M&A transaction.” Goldman Sachs plans to make a joint bid with German insurer Allianz, the London-based Times reported yesterday, without saying where it got the information. Citigroup Inc. will sell a 17 percent stake and M&G Investments will divest its 13 percent holding, the newspaper said. Goldman Sachs and Allianz declined to comment when Bloomberg News called. “In the absence of any concrete details of the bid package, the implied premium to Yorkshire Water’s regulated asset value looks at first glance to be slightly on the thin side,” said Ian Elkins, editor of Oxford, England-based publication Global Water Intelligence. While investors are attracted to the steady revenues that water assets bring, U.K. utilities are undergoing a regulatory shift. Industry watchdog Ofwat last month published changes to the way they can charge customers from 2015 to 2020. These include separate price controls for wholesale and retail arms to spur competition in the retail market by allowing non-household customers to choose suppliers. Lower Offer Pressure on the selling shareholders to offload their stakes before the price review may prompt the prospective buyers to offer a lower valuation multiple, Elkins said by e-mail. “We expect this deal to be the last sizeable deal in the regulated water utilities space in the U.K. until after the results of the next price review are known,” he said. Utilities have until Dec. 2 to submit their business plans and Ofwat will make final decisions on prices in 2015. Other U.K. water companies have been subject to takeover talk. The Daily Mail in April said state-owned Abu Dhabi Investment Authority was considering a bid for Pennon Group Plc (PNN) , while the Times said United Utilities Group Plc (UU/) hired Goldman Sachs amid speculation of a possible takeover. Severn Trent Plc (SVT) rejected a takeover offer in June, saying it was too low. “The few expected changes to the regulatory regime over the next few years do not seem to detract from the attractiveness of stable, long-term returns that water investments offer investors,” Andrew Cox, KPMG LLP’s global head of energy and natural resources for transactions and restructuring, said today by e-mail. “There are a limited number of such investment opportunities available.”')\n",

Commissioners approved a rule excluding inter-affiliate trades from requirements that swaps be guaranteed at clearinghouses that protect buyers and sellers against defaults, the CFTC said yesterday. The rule is part of the CFTC’s mandate to cut risk and expand transparency in the $639 trillion global swaps market. “The rule requires documentation of such exempted swaps, centralized risk management and reporting requirements for such swaps,” CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a statement. Lobby groups for banks including New York-based JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and London-based Barclays urged Gensler’s agency to exclude such trades from Dodd-Frank rules enacted in response to the 2008 credit crisis. Prudential Financial Inc. and a group of so-called end-users -- commercial and manufacturing firms that use swaps to hedge risk -- also sought exemption. “Interaffiliate swaps do not introduce risks to a corporate group,” Robert Pickel , chief executive officer of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc., and Ken Bentsen , executive vice president at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said in a Sept. 20 letter to the CFTC. “They allocate and transfer risks among group members.” Unrelated Counterparties The exemption is allowed for swaps between majority-owned affiliates of companies that file consolidated financial statements, Gensler said in the statement. Swaps between affiliates and other unrelated counterparties must be cleared. The CFTC granted a greater exemption than originally proposed in 2012 by not requiring variation margin for interaffiliate swaps. “The commission was guided by comments expressing concern that a variation margin requirement will limit the ability of U.S. companies to efficiently allocate risk among affiliates and manage risk centrally,” the agency said in the rule. Variation margin is typically exchanged daily to offset the risk from incremental price movements in a trade. “This is another demonstration of the industry dominance of the regulatory process,” Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform, said in a statement today. “Regulators are willing to accommodate industry even to the extent of dropping requirements that financial entities follow sound business practices.”')\n",

Abbas’s late predecessor Yasser Arafat would rest his hand on the chair’s back in a gesture of his yearning for statehood. The Palestinians were upgraded last year by the UN to join the Holy See as an “observer state,” which grants it the right to join UN agencies and sign treaties, though not the right to vote on resolutions. The authority used the Holy See as the precedent to make its case with the UN Office of Legal Affairs, according to the Palestinian diplomat. Pope Paul VI was permitted to sit in the chair for the first time on Oct. 4, 1965, a year after the Holy See was upgraded to observer status, the diplomat said. UN spokesman Martin Nesirky said in an e-mail that the UN’s Office of Legal Affairs had advised that Abbas may use the chair because the Pope also uses it in his capacity as representative of an observer state. Israel opposed the UN General Assembly vote in November that gave the Palestinians observer status. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the UN vote, which his office called a “meaningless decision,” would hinder the peace process.

We can be a net exporter by 2020.” Shale oil and gas has led to a boom in energy production, pushed natural gas prices lower, and by some estimates may allow the U.S. to meet its energy needs with domestic resources for the first time in decades. To tap the resources, millions of gallons of water are mixed with chemicals and sand and shot underground to break apart rock and free trapped gas or oil. Critics have said the process, known as fracking, endangers water supplies, while the industry maintains that no confirmed case of such contamination has been demonstrated scientifically. Pagliuca, who helped build Boston-based Bain into a private-equity firm with $70 billion in assets under management, said the largest challenges to the U.S. economic recovery are the effects of slowing stimulus and swelling national debt. The government’s actions to address the deficit have not been swift enough, he said. ‘Sipping Ouzos’ “If you look at politicians, they’ve only reacted to crisis,” said Pagliuca, a co-owner of the Boston Celtics. “In Greece everything was fine and people were at the beach and they were sipping ouzos until everything fell apart. And everything’s going to be fine here until it isn’t fine.” Pagliuca said he sees opportunities for private-equity deals in the U.S. as health care is reformed and technology companies seek to lower the cost of medical care. He also pointed to opportunities in China. “I don’t see a dramatic crash in the future,” Pagliuca said. “You still have a population that needs to lift up, and you have growth rates of 7 to 8 percent.” Bain last year raised its second fund dedicated to Asia , closing on $2.3 billion. The firm’s previous Asia fund, raised in 2007 with $1 billion, had a 4.3 percent net internal rate of return as of Sept. 30, according to data from California State Teachers’ Retirement System, an investor in the pool.')\n",

The vote on the bill, H.R. 2231, was 235-186. The measure would require the Obama administration to conduct additional sales of oil and gas leases off the coasts of Virginia , South Carolina, southern California and Alaska over the next five years, reports Bloomberg BNA. In addition, it would order the administration to create a plan that would open up almost all of the nation’s coastline for exploration; a draft would be due July 15, 2014, and a final plan approved by July 15, 2015. “This bill doesn’t harm the environment,” said Washington state Republican Doc Hastings, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. “We want to drill safely and responsibly.” The Senate isn’t expected to take up the legislation. The White House Office of Management and Budget issued a June 25 statement of administration policy warning of a potential veto. The measure “would undermine the targeted, science-based and regionally tailored development strategy that the American people and the states have helped development,” according to that statement. The requirement that the Interior Department open new areas for exploration “would be directed without secretarial discretion to determine whether those areas are appropriate for leasing,” the agency said. Expanded offshore leasing would benefit the large oil companies, which have the resources to finance the high startup costs, according to Bloomberg Government analyst Jason Arvelo. ConocoPhillips (COP) , Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) were among the most active in the federal offshore leasing circuit in 2012 and 2013.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) will spend $1 billion a year developing China ’s unconventional gas reserves, including shale deposits, according to Peter Voser , the company’s chief executive. Shell has won government approval for its production sharing contract with China National Petroleum Corp., the nation’s biggest oil and gas company, Voser said in an interview in Beijing today. He didn’t specify details for the $1 billion investment. China is working with overseas partners to introduce hydraulic fracturing, the technology known as fracking that breaks open underground shale rocks to release natural gas, as it seeks to boost domestic consumption of the cleaner-burning fuel. Shell and CNPC had drilled 24 wells by November and planned a further 14 this year, Maarten Wetselaar, executive vice president of Shell Upstream International, said Nov. 15. “I welcome the aggressive target of the government in the 12th five year plan and its long-term objective to make gas a significant component of its energy mix,” Voser said today. “This is the right energy source for the longer term for China given its advantage from the perspectives of carbon dioxide versus coal and oil.” China’s annual gas consumption will increase by 20 billion cubic meters every year to 230 billion by 2015 under the 12th five-year plan, the Beijing-based National Energy Administration said in a Dec. 3 report. About 250 million urban residents, or 18 percent of the population, will use gas by 2015, the report showed. Production Sharing Shell and CNPC, the state-controlled parent of PetroChina Co.

Poston from practicing before securities regulators for one year after finding accounting irregularities tied to commercial loans. The dispute concerns how Fifth Third, Ohio ’s biggest bank, accounted for certain loans in 2008, the Cincinnati-based company said yesterday in a statement. Former Treasurer Tayfun Tuzun was appointed chief financial officer, effective Oct. 31, and Poston was named chief strategy and administrative officer, the lender said. “This is obviously an agreement in principle that we hope to achieve closure to as soon as possible,” Larry Magnesen, a bank spokesman, said in a phone interview. Poston’s role change is “not a demotion” and he will continue reporting to Chief Executive Officer Kevin Kabat, Magnesen said. Poston is in discussions that would require him, “without admitting or denying any factual allegations ,” to agree to a cease-and-desist order, a civil money penalty, and a one-year ban from practicing before the SEC, according to the statement. Under such a ban, Poston would no longer represent the company in any interactions with the SEC. Fifth Third, also without admitting or denying any factual allegations, would consent to a finding that the company didn’t properly account for a portion of its commercial real estate loan portfolio and pay a penalty. The amount, which wasn’t specified, would be covered by reserves, the lender said. Magnesen said Poston had no comment, and Poston didn’t respond to an e-mailed request for an interview. John Nester , an SEC spokesman, declined to comment. Classifying Loans The SEC, which began its probe about three years ago, has been investigating whether some of Fifth Third’s loans should have been designated as held-for-sale in the third quarter of 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, instead of the fourth quarter of that year, the company said. Reclassifying loans as held-for-sale instead of held-to-maturity means the assets have to be marked to market. In August, Fifth Third restated second-quarter results, saying earnings were $12 million less than previously reported as it added to a reserve for litigation costs. The company sees no need to restate 2008 results, Magnesen said.

(G) , the biggest gold producer by market value, wrote down the value of assets by $1.96 billion and is slowing some project spending because of lower metal prices. The writedown helped lead to a second-quarter net loss of $1.93 billion, or $2.38 a share, compared with net income of $268 million, or 26 cents, a year earlier, the Vancouver-based miner said today in a statement. Profit excluding the writedown and other one-time items was 14 cents a share, trailing the 23-cent average of 19 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 18 percent to $889 million, missing the $1.15 billion average estimate. Gold-mining companies have announced at least $13 billion of writedowns in the past two months after the precious metal’s steepest quarterly drop in London trading in more than nine decades. Goldcorp said its writedown was mainly related to the value of exploration potential at its Penasquito mine in Mexico , its biggest source of revenue last year. “Penasquito continues to possess strong exploration upside, but due to lower metals prices, the current in situ market value of exploration potential has decreased significantly,” Chief Executive Officer Chuck Jeannes said in the statement. Shares Drop Goldcorp fell 1.2 percent to C$28.88 at the close in Toronto, compared with a 0.5 percent increase for the S&P/TSX Global Gold Sector Index of 50 companies. Goldcorp is reviewing operating plans and will defer some spending this year and next at mines it’s building in Argentina and Canada. The changes aren’t expected to have material impacts on project schedules, the company said. Capital spending will be about $2.6 billion, or $200 million lower than a previous forecast, Goldcorp said. The company also plans to cut administration expenses by about 10 percent and reduce its exploration budget by 11 percent. Gold, which rose for 12 consecutive years, slipped into a bear market in April and has dropped 21 percent this year in New York.

Jeannes said profit was affected by the timing of gold sales. Goldcorp sold about half of the gold and silver in the quarter in June, when gold prices fell to a 34-month low.

It forecast a net loss of as much as 350 million euros this year, and said profit will recover in 2014. ‘Dramatic Escalation’ “Since my appointment as chief executive, I have been focused on the cleanup of major legacy issues which have proved to be of greater magnitude than we envisaged,” Vergine said in a June 14 statement. “In Algeria, our business has been impacted by a dramatic escalation of the investigation in the country and the consequent commercial fallout.” Saipem’s Algeria unit is contending with frozen accounts amid the corruption probe into contract awards. Saipem said it’s offered its full cooperation to the prosecutor’s office. Parent company Eni SpA dropped as much as 4.9 percent in Milan today and closed down 2.1 percent at 16.5 euros. “The scale of the deterioration of Saipem’s performance will start to impact Eni’s own performance and could constrain its ability to grow cash returns to shareholders,” Exane BNP Paribas wrote in a note today.

Violence erupted after Jamaat-e-Islami leader Delwar Hossain Sayedee, 73, was sentenced to death for crimes committed more than four decades ago during the country’s war of independence. Jamaat-e-Islami activists rioted in northern Bangladesh, attacking police outposts and vandalizing government buildings in violence that also left two children dead, according to RTV television and the Daily Star newspaper. The government denied reports that troops were being deployed to quell disturbances. Sayedee was found guilty at a war crimes tribunal investigating atrocities committed during the 1971 war. The clashes have exposed the deep divisions in Bangladesh over the war. “Bangladesh is going through an important phase, which may be painful for the time being,” said Shantanu Majumder, a political science teacher at Dhaka University. “It’s a battle between liberal democracy and religious extremism.” The mainly secularist, middle-class protesters have been occupying a square in Bangladesh’s capital since Feb. 5 demanding harsher penalties for those found guilty by the tribunal. Supporters of Islamic parties say the trials are politically motivated. Security Tightened? As police and paramilitary forces continued to tighten security across the country, Home Minister Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir denied that the army had entered some areas.

In Dhaka, banks and other financial institutions were open. Buses and trains were operating normally in the capital. The violence coincided with the visit of Indian President Pranab Mukherjee to Bangladesh on his first trip overseas since taking office in July. At the end of British colonial rule in 1947, East and West Pakistan were separated by 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) of Indian territory.

The Seton Hall poll found that 37 percent of those surveyed want the ban upheld, while an additional 35 percent would favor having him banned for life. Rodriguez filed an appeal with an independent arbitrator Aug. 6, one day after MLB suspended him without pay through the 2014 season. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig accused Rodriguez of using testosterone and human growth hormone for several years and of trying to “obstruct and frustrate” baseball’s probe of a now-closed Miami clinic that MLB accuses of supplying performance-enhancing substances to players. Rodriguez, 38, began the appeal before a three-person arbitration panel in New York on Sept. 30 and is expected to wrap up his case this week, according to a report in the New York Daily News. Selig said last week that he will retire as commissioner after the 2014 season. Of those polled, 57 percent said he will enjoy a positive or extremely positive legacy, 20 percent said it would be negative or extremely negative, and 24 percent said they did not know. “It would appear that the continuing appeal of the game under his reign -- in attendance, marketing, expanded playoffs, popular new ballparks and more -- will override the steroid issue in people’s minds,” Rick Gentile , director of the poll sponsored by the Sharkey Institute, said in a release. “Of course, responses could also be influenced by his battling the very unpopular Rodriguez on the steroid issue.” The survey, with a 4 percent margin of error, was based on random phone calls to the landlines and mobile phones of 668 American adults between Sept. 30 and Oct. 2, according to Seton Hall , which is based in South Orange, New Jersey.')\n",

(GOOG) said a lawsuit by Max Mosley, Formula One’s former president, asking it to block any further search results referring to a “Nazi-themed” sex party would create unprecedented censorship on the Internet. Lawyers for Mosley asked a French court today to force Google, the owner of the world’s most-used Internet search engine, to build software filters that would detect and delete certain content, Daphne Keller, an associate general counsel at Google, said in a post on its website. “We have removed hundreds of pages for Mr. Mosley, and stand ready to remove others he identifies,” Keller said. “But the law does not support Mr. Mosley’s demand for the construction of an unprecedented new Internet censorship tool.” Mosley, 73, won a 60,000 pound ($94,000) breach-of-privacy award in a U.K. court in 2008 from News Corp.’s now-defunct News of the World newspaper for publishing the story on a Nazi-themed “orgy,” along with a video, without contacting him. A judge ruled there was no Nazi theme and the story wasn’t in the public interest. Mosley won a similar ruling in France in 2011 when a judge ordered News Corp. to pay as much as 32,000 euros in fines and fees over the story. Mosley in 2011 told a U.K. inquiry investigating the phone-hacking scandal at News Corp. that he filed suits against Google in Germany and France over the search results. ‘People’s Dignity’ France and Germany are “pilot cases” and depending on how successful Mosley is, and if he doesn’t reach an agreement with Google out of court, there will be more lawsuits, said Tanja Irion, a lawyer representing Mosley at law firm Irion in Hamburg, Germany. The suits could be filed in other EU countries and in Mountain View, California , where Google is based, she said. “The case is very important, not only for Mr. Mosley, also generally for the protection of people’s dignity and privacy on the Internet,” Irion said. The German case will be heard by the Hamburg court on September 20, the court’s press office said today. Rulings in both cases can be appealed. The case raises similar issues with a Belgian suit that ended up in the EU’s top court, testing the scope of the powers of national courts.

The index dropped 5.2 percent yesterday after MSCI said it may review the nation’s emerging-market status if a foreign-currency shortage worsens. “Yesterday’s drop may have signaled to some investors that the market is oversold,” Hassan Kenawi, equities trader at Cairo-based HC Brokerage, said by phone. “The market’s overall decline remains due to the political tension that is building toward the end of the month, so today’s gain won’t likely be sustained.” Anti-government activists are preparing for nationwide demonstrations at the end of the month.

Conservatives are at a low boil over the administration’s dissembling about its actions after the attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. The public is concerned about the targeting of conservative groups by the Internal Revenue Service. And even liberals are outraged by the administration’s heavy-handed investigations of leaks to the news media. Finally, many Republicans think, the tide is turning against the Democrats. Republican strategists -- and the few conservatives on Capitol Hill who were in Washington during the Clinton years -- are less excited. They fear that the party is about to repeat the mistakes it made in 1998. Early that year, it came to light that President Bill Clinton had had a sexual relationship with a White House intern and lied about it to the public, to a court in a civil suit and to a grand jury in a criminal case. Congressional Republicans tried to remove him from office. The public hated the idea, and Republicans lost seats in the fall elections. They had been expected to make significant gains because the opposition party usually did in the sixth year of a presidency. House Speaker Newt Gingrich lost his job largely as a result. History Repeating Watch the way the Republicans are handling today’s controversies and it’s easy to see how their tactics could backfire again. You would expect that Senator Lindsey Graham, who helped to lead the impeachment proceedings against Clinton, had learned to be cautious in pursuing a scandal. Yet he decided to tie the Benghazi investigation explicitly to the 2016 presidential race, saying that the controversy would doom Hillary Clinton. If Graham were a Democratic plant trying to make the investigation look like a merely partisan exercise, he couldn’t have done better. Republicans are trying to tie IRS misconduct to President Barack Obama , so far without much evidence. The Republican National Committee is demanding that the president apologize to targeted groups, apparently on the assumption that the public isn’t satisfied with his calling the IRS’s actions “intolerable and inexcusable.” Other Republicans are saying that the president created a “culture” that made the scandal possible by being a partisan Democrat. These efforts are strained. If the evidence leads to the conclusion that the IRS bureaucracy acted on its own, that is scandal enough; it would serve to strengthen the public’s conservative instincts about the dangers of trusting the government, whoever happens to be in the Oval Office. Republicans shouldn’t be obsessed with Obama, who won’t be on the ballot again, and shouldn’t make a legitimate inquiry into potential abuses of power appear to be -- or, worse, actually be')\n",

Jurors deliberated four hours before convicting George yesterday of four wire-fraud counts in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey, Fishman said in a statement. George testified in his own defense. Jurors heard from Charlie Villanueva of the Detroit Pistons and former NBA player Brevin Knight, who were victims. George, a Newark resident, told prospective investors that their money would fund the George Group’s development of real estate projects in New Jersey and Connecticut, prosecutors charged. George raised more than $2 million for his company, the George Group, after telling investors his real-estate development portfolio was worth $500 million, prosecutors said. “Instead of using investments to fund real estate development projects as promised, George used the money from new investors to pay existing investors in Ponzi-scheme fashion,” Fishman said in the statement. George, 45, also used the money to pay for a Sweet 16 party for his daughter, renovations on his New Jersey home, mortgages on homes in New Jersey home and Florida , taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service, traffic tickets and a reality video about himself, prosecutors said. “The George Group had virtually no income-generating operations,” Fishman said in the statement. In Custody He was immediately taken into custody until his sentencing on Jan. 16 by U.S. District Judge Mary L. Cooper, according to Fishman. He faces as long as 20 years in prison on each count. His assistant federal public defender, David Schafer, declined to comment on the case. Schafer said that aside from Villanueva and Knight, the witnesses against George included Randal Pinkett, a business consultant who was a winner of the reality television show “The Apprentice.” George was arrested in September 2011 on a Federal Bureau of Investigation complaint charging him with one count of wire fraud. His trial started Sept. 9. George attended the University of Connecticut , where he hit the game-winning shot against Clemson University in the third round of the 1990 National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. With one second remaining and Connecticut trailing by one, George caught a full-court pass from teammate Scott Burrell, spun around and hit a 15-foot jump shot as time expired. He was selected by the Nets with the No. 22 pick in the 1990 NBA draft. The Nets have since moved to Brooklyn , New York. In a four-year career, George averaged 4.2 points and 1.8 assists a game.

Kemira is looking to add technology and broaden its product range in areas including additives used in oil and mining. While assets are available in those industries, price tags are currently out of synch with buyers’ budgets, the former BASF SE (BAS) executive said in an interview. “A lot of companies in the oil and mining space, particularly in the U.S., are per se available, but the asking multiple is so high, you have to ask yourself does this really make sense,” said Buechele. “The longer the market is in a wait-and-see position, the more inclined the sellers will be become to revisit their asking price, that’s my assumption.” A year into his role, Buechele is pushing through a transformation of the 93-year-old company, pursuing growth in paper as well as oil and mining additives. Units making water- treatment chemicals and bleaching agents will be optimized for efficiency and run for cash. Buechele plans to raise profitability to 15 percent by 2016 from 8 percent last year in terms of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as a proportion of sales. The paper, oil and mining markets have better prospects than water purification for municipalities.

Non- financial counterparties gained an extension to Oct. 31 for certain reporting requirements for all swap asset classes. “I am troubled by the arbitrary and ad-hoc manner in which this relief was provided,” CFTC Commissioner Scott O’Malia , a Republican, said in a statement. “The application of date, product and participant distinctions makes compliance and implementation confusing for the end users.” The CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission are implementing derivatives provisions of Dodd-Frank, the 2010 regulatory overhaul, after largely unsupervised trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. New rules planned for the $639 trillion global swaps market require that trade information be reported to so-called swap data repositories that function as central record-keepers. The Commercial Energy Working Group, an alliance of companies that weren’t identified individually, requested a six- month delay through lawyers at Sutherland Asbill & Brennan LLP in a March 1 letter to the CFTC. “Of all the different groups that would be responsible for reporting, they are probably the least prepared,” Brenda Boultwood, vice president of industry solutions at Palo Alto, California-based MetricStream, which helps clients manage regulatory compliance, said in a telephone interview before the delay was announced. Lobbying groups representing Barclays Plc (BARC) , JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) have also urged that the CFTC delay the reporting rules for their clients. In a March 28 letter to the CFTC, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. and Financial Services Roundtable said bank clients need a delay because they lack the resources to comply with the rules.')\n",

The State Bank of Vietnam lowered the refinance rate to 8 percent from 9 percent and the discount rate to 6 percent from 7 percent, according to a statement on its website. It also reduced the cap on dong deposit interest rates to 7.5 percent from 8 percent. The new rates are effective March 26. Vietnam last reduced borrowing costs in December, even as the World Bank said the nation faces the risk of premature easing that may trigger a resurgence in inflation. The economy grew 5.03 percent last year after rising levels of bad debt at lenders curbed expansion, leading the government to pledge to speed up the restructuring of its banking system. “A lower deposit interest rate cap will enable banks to reduce lending rates and give more loans, which can bolster businesses,” Hoang Thach Lan, head of the brokerage unit at Ho Chi Minh City-based MHB Securities Co., said before the decision. “It may fuel inflation though, so we need to be mindful.” The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s VN Index gained 0.7 percent at the close today. The dong was little changed at 20,945 against the dollar. Consumer prices rose 6.64 percent in March from a year earlier, after climbing 7.02 percent in February, according to government data. The central bank said in December it is targeting credit growth of 12 percent this year, up from about 7 percent in 2012. Bank loan growth fell 0.28 percent in the January-to-February period from the end of last year, according to government data. Master Plan Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung in February approved a master plan to revamp the economy and said a roadmap to clean up state-owned enterprises that account for about 37 percent of gross domestic product will be ready by June. In March, he appointed Deputy Prime Minister Vu Van Ninh and central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh to oversee a panel to restructure the banking system by 2015. The health of Vietnam’s lenders is a growing concern, the World Bank said in December, citing their deteriorating asset quality and slow progress in restructuring. The lender forecasts economic expansion will be 5.5 percent this year, a third straight year of growth below 6 percent. Slower economic growth curbed import demand and helped Vietnam post an annual trade surplus last year for the first time in two decades.

The manufacturers have gradually added projects to their three-year-old cooperation, which was originally focused on Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler’s Smart city cars and Mercedes-Benz delivery vans. Last year, the companies agreed to jointly develop a four-cylinder gasoline engine and to license Mercedes transmissions for Nissan’s Infiniti luxury brand to be made in Mexico. “There’s no limit to the cooperation, there’s no taboo,” Carlos Ghosn , chief executive officer at both Renault and Nissan, said at the event. Tennessee Production The ramp up of a joint engine production in Decherd, Tennessee is on track for production start in mid-2014, Ghosn said. The engines will be used in the mid-sized Mercedes-Benz C-Class and new Nissan Infiniti cars. Mercedes and Infiniti are not competing for the same customers, said Ghosn. “Cross-shopping between the two brands is limited.” The two partners will also look into a possible cooperation in the large van segment even as talks haven’t started yet, Zetsche said. A Daimler contract to rebadge the Mercedes Sprinter for Volkswagen AG (VOW) will cease at the end of 2016, Daimler said last week. The decision to end production for Volkswagen was independent of any possible cooperation with Renault-Nissan, Zetsche said. Daimler and Renault, which is based in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, cooperate on Daimler’s smaller Citan delivery van, which the German company adapted from Renault’s Kangoo. The manufacturers are also considering teaming up on future compact car models. The review continues and no decision on a possible joint production in Mexico has been made, Ghosn said.')\n",

Anything less than a 1 billion-euro “upfront return” would be disappointing, said John Kershaw, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. He expects the retailer to return 1.5 billion euros through a special dividend and share consolidation, while adding 500 million euros to the buyback program announced on Feb. 28. An announcement is expected by analysts when Amsterdam-based Ahold announces first-quarter results on June 4. The owner of the Albert Heijn chain sold its 60 percent stake in ICA to Hakon Invest AB, a Swedish investment company , for $3.1 billion in February. The Dutch retailer had announced in September it was exploring alternatives for its stake because it aimed to focus on the businesses that it controls. “I expect them to tell the market they will give back proceeds from the ICA sale in full,” Robert Jan Vos, an analyst at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, said in a phone interview. “They could do a split between 1 billion euros in capital payments and on top an additional 1.5 billion-euro share buyback.” Mike Dennis, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald , expects the company to announce a repurchase or tender of 1.8 billion euros, while Marco Gulpers at ING in Amsterdam sees Ahold returning “a large part of the cash proceeds,” he said in a note. Still, not all analysts are convinced that Ahold should redistribute all of the sale proceeds. Acquisitions are another possibility, according to Fernand de Boer at Petercam SA. M&A Opportunities “I don’t expect much on Tuesday because I think management wants to give themselves more time to look at opportunities,” De Boer said in a phone interview. “If they announce a huge share buyback then they will have less room to maneuver for good M&A opportunities. Giving all the money back to shareholders within a few months doesn’t make much sense.” De Boer views an acquisition of U.S. grocery-store chain Harris Teeter Supermarkets Inc. as unlikely because the valuation of that business is “fairly demanding” and Harris Teeter (HTSI) has a “different distribution philosophy.” The Matthews, North Carolina-based retailer has attracted interest from Ahold, people familiar with the matter said in February. Harris Teeter disclosed in February that it hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. after receiving advances from two private-equity firms.

Regulators need an “institutional will” as well as legal authority, Stein said in a speech prepared for delivery in Boston today. “It is incumbent on us as regulators to do all that we can to develop both the intellectual case, and the institutional resolve, to be able to push back with equal force when the time comes.” Policy makers and academics are debating whether monetary policy as well as regulatory controls should be used in response to financial stability concerns such as asset-price bubbles in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Stein said. While that question hasn’t been settled, more forceful action by regulators is clearly needed, he said. For example, a banking firm facing a shortage of capital in time of crisis might prefer to shrink its size to meet regulatory capital levels rather than sell stock that dilutes existing shareholders, “even though the latter is more desirable from the perspective of aggregate credit provision,” Stein said at a National Bureau of Economic Research conference. Stein didn’t address the current economy or current financial market conditions in his prepared remarks. Stein warned in February that some credit markets, such as corporate debt, were showing signs of excessive risk-taking, and said the Fed should be open to using policy tools such as interest rates to safeguard stability. “We are seeing a fairly significant pattern of reaching-for-yield behavior emerging in corporate credit,” Stein said then. Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George has dissented at every Fed policy meeting this year, warning the bond-buying program and near zero rates risk creating imbalances in the economy and financial markets and pushing up long-term inflation expectations.

During recent layovers in Minneapolis-St. Paul and Detroit airport, he said, he scoured numerous newsstands as well as a full-size bookstore, autograph pen in hand, searching in vain for a copy of Cockpit Confidential. Even store managers who were sympathetic to him said they couldn\\'t do anything—purchasing decisions are made at some far-off corporate headquarters. So, why can\\'t you find one of the best books on air travel at an airport? The answer is depressingly mundane: airport booksellers are really just giant nationwide retailing chains, and given the tight space constraints and costs of running an airport location, they\\'ll just go with the safest choices: the latest bestsellers, children\\'s books, and business how-to tomes. As Smith himself noted when persuing the shelves—\"they did have 15 copies of the latest Mike Piazza autobiography,\" plus others by such well-known belle-lettrists such as Carol Burnett and accused killer Amanda Knox. Although several airport concession operators (including HMS Host) have no plans to stock it, there has been some good news: The book will apparently be sold through one of the major airport retailers, Hudson Booksellers, which has outlets at dozens of U.S. airports. Even so, several of the largest airport concession operators, such as HMS Host, have no plans to stock it, Smith said.

The Uruguayan agreed to a two-year contract and will be joined by his assistants Mauricio Taricco and Charlie Oatway, Sunderland said in a statement. Poyet, who was fired for misconduct by second-tier Brighton on June 23, is the northeast England team’s sixth manager in five years. Sunderland, which has one point from seven matches, fired Di Canio on Sept. 22 after six months in charge. The last team to avoid relegation after taking a single point from its opening seven Premier League games was Newcastle in 1999-2000, according to Opta Sports. “We analyzed a wide range of candidates and believe that Gus’s track record, experience, commitment and passion make him the right man to take us forward,” Sunderland Chairman Ellis Short said in the statement on the team’s website. Poyet, a former Chelsea and Tottenham midfielder, coached Brighton for four years. He unsuccessfully appealed in July against his dismissal, the reason for which hasn’t been revealed by Poyet or the club. Poyet, 45, guided Brighton to the third-tier League One title in 2011, 17 months after taking over, and was voted manager of the year by the division’s coaches. The Seagulls finished fourth in the Championship last season, their highest league finish for 30 years, and lost to Crystal Palace in the semifinals of the playoffs for a Premier League berth. Coaching Career He began his coaching career in England in 2006 as assistant manager at Swindon Town, before taking a similar role with Leeds United. Poyet returned to former club Tottenham as first-team coach before becoming assistant manager to Juande Ramos and then joined Brighton in 2009. Di Canio won three of his 13 games after replacing Martin O’Neill as Sunderland coach in March. The day after the team lost 3-0 at West Bromwich Albion on Sept. 21, players approached the club’s Chief Executive Officer Margaret Byrne to complain about Di Canio, the BBC  reported. He was fired the same day. Kevin Ball, the club’s senior professional development coach, has been in temporary charge of the team.')\n",

The chief executive officers of three of Europe ’s largest banks defended themselves against criticism they’re companies are too big, saying the region needs lenders with scale to support clients around the world. At a conference in Frankfurt today, Frederic Oudea , who heads Societe Generale SA (GLE) , cited the need for lenders to be able to fund billion-dollar deals, while Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) co-CEO Anshu Jain said clients want banks that can provide an array of financial services. Federico Ghizzoni, CEO of Italy’s UniCredit SpA (UCG) , said growth of companies outside their domestic market will require banks able to make investments in their infrastructure. Global leaders have ordered banks to raise capital to avoid a repeat of the taxpayer-funded rescues that followed the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. While the CEOs voiced support for the rules designed to bolster the financial health of their firms, they warned European regulators against overreach that could put them at a disadvantage to competitors in the U.S. and elsewhere. “Size matters, there’s no discussion,” said Ghizzoni, who leads Italy ’s largest bank. “More capital, less leverage, more stringent liquidity ratio and so forth plus competition means we’re under pressure on revenues. At the same time as we have discussed so far, there is a huge need for investment.” ‘Cheap Money’ In Europe, “only” 13 lenders operate in more than 10 countries, according to Ghizzoni. There are “a few banks that will be big by nature in order to compete with the large universal banks in the U.S.,” said Oudea, who heads France ’s second-largest bank based in Paris. Some speakers at the conference organized by Euroforum and Handelsblatt newspaper signaled concerns. “There’s been an acknowledgment that the significant causes of the financial crisis were down to too much cheap money, wrong calculation of risks, excessive leverage and large banks taking too much risk,” said Georg Fahrenschon, president of the DSGV association of German savings banks. Small lenders can’t be “liable for large ones, potentially even guaranteeing the existence of systemically relevant institutions.” Jain, who runs Deutsche Bank with Juergen Fitschen, said that while “big means complex” and “complex means expensive,” Germany still needs a lender able to support companies seeking to tap global economic growth. “There is a minimum scale expectation in terms of efficiency of platform and the breadth required to give your clients what they need,” he said. “On its own, no one wants to be big.”')\n",

It's wrong. The response Rubio gave to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech offered little that was new or interesting. It consisted mostly of lines that could have come from any Republican politician, at any time in the last four years. Rubio said that Obamacare is bad and will cost jobs. He said Obama will destroy jobs by raising taxes on employers -- by which Rubio means individuals with high incomes, since higher corporate income taxes are not on the table. He flippantly dismissed concerns about global warming, saying, “Our government can’t control the weather.” He repeated broad anti-government themes, saying, “More government isn’t going to help you get ahead. It’s going to hold you back.” As an\\xa0alternative he offered the Republican formula of lower taxes, less spending and less regulation, saying that would raise incomes and create middle-class prosperity. This is the case that Mitt Romney made against Obama in the 2012 election. It’s the case that Republican Senate candidates made all over the country. It is a case for trickle-down economics. And it is a case that Americans have rejected.\\xa0 Republicans think putting up a spokesman like Rubio, who is Hispanic and in favor of comprehensive immigration reform, will help them make inroads with minorities. But all of the large minority groups -- blacks, Hispanics and Asians -- look much more favorably on government than whites do, seeing it as an entity that can and should help people get ahead rather than just getting out of the way. In 2012, the Republican Party’s anti-government message left these groups cold, leading Romney to lose Hispanics by more than 2 to 1 and Asians by nearly 3 to 1. Immigration reform can’t overcome this message problem. As the country gets less and less white, reflexive “I Built It”-ism is only going to become more electorally costly to Republicans. The Republican Party’s problem isn’t the messenger; it’s the broad economic message. To fix the message, Republicans need to be for smart government. They need to signal that they have a serious policy agenda that considers programs and regulations on a case-by-case basis, rather than just demagoguing the government. They need a real agenda on health care and jobs rather than just opportunistic opposition to anything the president does. In other words, they need a message that befits a grown-up party that is ready to govern. Rubio, handsome and smooth though he is, did not offer that. And the Republican Party can only be saved by a messenger who does. (Josh Barro is lead writer for the Ticker. E-mail him at jbarro1@bloomberg.net and follow him on Twitter.)\")\n",

Osborne is facing pressure to ease the pace of his fiscal-consolidation plans in his March 20 annual budget as the economy stagnates. “We’re now into the second half of their office and it makes common sense for them that they cannot just carry on,” he said. “Whatever they call it, they will shift the broad net fiscal stance because it doesn’t seem to be delivering what they thought it would.” It is unclear what further quantitative easing by the Bank of England would do to improve the U.K. economy as the weakness of the pound is increasing import costs and “cramping” consumers, O’Neill said.')\n",

The European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will back the measure as part of a May 20 vote on a bank crisis law, according to a draft of amendments obtained by Bloomberg News. The move follows signals this week from German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble that he could accept the step as part of a compromise on the legislation. Lawmakers will also state that governments should have a clear right to inject capital into banks, or even nationalize them, as a last resort to protect financial stability, the documents show. The creditor writedown rules are part of a broader EU blueprint to take taxpayers off the front line for bailing out banks. Leaders of the EU’s 27 nations agreed last year that the proposals should be rapidly adopted and pave the way for further euro-area steps to pool decision-making for crisis-hit banks. The legislation must be agreed on by nations and by the EU Parliament before it takes effect. Monday’s committee vote will determine the assembly’s negotiating position. Under the plans, regulators would be given statutory powers to impose losses on unsecured creditors, while holders of secured debt, such as covered bonds, would be protected. Finance ministers this week indicated a growing willingness to give preference to depositors when assigning losses, with Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem joining Schaeuble in saying that he could back the step as part of an overall deal.

A judge overseeing a lawsuit by the CGT union aimed at canceling the workforce reduction asked Peugeot to postpone a meeting with labor leaders until after the court reaches a decision on April 26, Fiodor Rilov, the union’s lawyer, said by phone. The meeting to set financial terms for the reductions has been delayed to April 29 from April 19, Jean-Baptiste Mounier, a Peugeot spokesman, said in an e-mail. The CGT has three court cases opposing plans by Paris-based Peugeot, Europe ’s second-biggest carmaker, to scale back its domestic workforce by 11,200 employees, or 17 percent, in an effort to restore profit. Another five unions representing 76 percent of employees support the strategy. “A plan that is supported by unions representing more than 76 percent of employees is fully legitimate, so any other decision than the backing of that plan would be risky,” Yasmine Tarasewicz, the lawyer representing the carmaker in the legal cases, said in a phone interview. The delay in the labor leaders’ meeting with Peugeot means that workers who want to leave and benefit from severance payments must wait until mid-May, said Christian Lafaye, the leader of the FO union, which supports the plan. ‘Bad News’ “This postponement is bad news for the company as well as for the employees who want the plan to be fully implemented as soon as possible,” he said. Peugeot reported a 576 million-euro operating loss last year. Efforts to revive earnings include shuttering a factory in Aulnay, on the outskirts of Paris. The judge in the CGT court case asked for the union-management meeting delay at an April 11 hearing, Rilov said. Peugeot said on Feb. 13 that cost reductions in 2012 totaled 1.18 billion euros in 2012, beating a target of 1 billion euros. Asset disposals, including a stake in its Gefco trucking unit, totaled 2 billion euros. Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin pledged that day to bring the automaker to a break-even level by the end of 2014 through the reorganization and a new strategy that includes moving the Peugeot brand upscale. In a separate procedure, the Paris appeals court ruled on Jan. 28 that Peugeot had to suspend its plans to cut jobs and shutter the Aulnay site as employee representatives at Faurecia (EO) , the company’s 57 percent-owned auto-parts subsidiary had to be informed about the consequences of the program.

Krzanich said he and newly promoted company President Renee James will try to make Intel more outward-looking in order to predict future trends in computing, Krzanich said. That’s more important as consumers, rather than corporations, take the leading role in determining which devices and technologies are successful, Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said in an interview following today’s meeting. “The lifecycle of those devices and the lifecycle of the leadership of the market is very short,” he said. “The consumer is driving these very fast technology shifts.” Krzanich, a former factory manager, succeeds Paul Otellini , who retired. Intel has improved its execution in creating products for new markets and Krzanich, with his background in operations, is very focused on making sure that there are no slip ups, said Smith.

(C) in response to a request from Senators David Vitter , a Louisiana Republican, and Sherrod Brown , an Ohio Democrat. Vitter and Brown made the request that the GAO look at bank holding companies with assets more than $500 billion after leaders in the Republican-controlled House refused to take up their Senate bill, which passed unanimously. “Though Congress has enacted financial sector reforms that its supporters, both in Congress and the administration, intended to mitigate the TBTF problem, we are concerned that these measures may not be sufficient to eliminate government support,” Vitter and Brown wrote in their letter to the GAO. Lawmakers and regulators have said that Dodd-Frank, the 2010 measure enacted in response to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, ended too-big-to-fail by creating ways to unwind complex banks without taxpayer assistance. The study sought by Vitter and Brown would look at whether the pricing of the banks’ assets relative to their risk profile results in a perception that they would get bailouts if needed, whether they get favorable funding as a result of increased credit ratings based on the view that they are too big to fail and how they benefit from access to the Federal Reserve ’s discount window. Nine systemically important banks including JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America got a total of $125 billion in taxpayer aid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program after a credit freeze following the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

China has cut the cables of survey ships working for Vietnam , and its dispute with the Philippines has led to several standoffs between Chinese and Philippine vessels.

The FAA also said it may eliminate night shifts at 72 towers and regional radar rooms. Fifty-four of those already met guidance for closing during those periods because of low traffic, according to agency data compiled by Bloomberg. The FAA has been thwarted in previous attempts to close towers and radar rooms at little-used airports, including Huntington, because of pressure from members of Congress, Bloomberg News reported last year. The agency would save $10 million a year by ending night shifts at the 102 U.S. air-traffic towers and radar rooms that operate overnight without the traffic to justify it, Bloomberg reported.

The malfunctions began about 10:30 a.m. Dallas time, and systems were restored about 3:30 p.m., Huguely said. “We do have redundancies in our systems,” Chief Executive Officer Tom Horton said in a video posted on the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline’s website. “Unfortunately, in this case we had a software issue that impacted both our primary and backup systems.” The carrier is “very sorry” for disrupting passengers’ travel plans, Horton said. A combined 978 flights were canceled at American and AMR’s American Eagle regional unit. American, which is preparing to merge with US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) , is allowing passengers with flexible schedules to change reservations at no charge and is providing full refunds to those who can’t alter plans. ‘Technology Emergency’ “This is a technology emergency,” Henry Harteveldt , an analyst at Hudson Crossing in San Francisco, said yesterday. “I don’t think American has experienced anything like this in a long time, if at all.” United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) in November struggled with its third computer failure of the year when the dispatching system failed, interrupting service for about two hours. In March of last year, Chicago-based United’s website and airport kiosks were disrupted when the company combined reservation systems for United Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc. following their 2010 merger.

Italy will train at Rio de Janeiro Joao Havelange stadium during the eight-team Confederations Cup. That stadium, built in 2007, is indefinitely shut to the public after signs of wear were found on its roof. Local Organizing committee spokesman Saint-Clair Milesi wasn’t immediately able to comment. “The Local Organising Committee and FIFA are aware of the partial rupture of one of the 36 membrane panels of the roof of the Arena Fonte Nova,” FIFA said today in a statement. “The repairs are already underway. The causes for this rupture are currently being evaluated including a detailed assessment of all panels. The LOC is monitoring the repairs through their on-site experts.” Brazil’s stadium preparation program for the month-long World Cup has been hurt by delays and cost overruns on several projects. The Marcana stadium in Rio de Janeiro, which will host the final game of the tournament, was opened several months after a second-deadline from FIFA in December because the stadium’s roof needed to be rebuilt. Only two of the six stadiums being used at the Confederations Cup met FIFA’s deadline, meaning the governing body had to backtrack on a demand that each venue host three test events before the tournament begins on June 15. On June 2 Brazil hosts England in an exhibition game at the Maracana, the first time the stadium has operated at full capacity since its three-year refurbishment, which cost more than $500 million. While workers were attempting to fix the problem with the roof, Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff said in a weekly radio address that she was certain the country “will shine on and off the field.” The 56,000-seat Fonte Nova stadium was opened in April and will host three games during the Confederations Cup, including Brazil’s match with Italy on June 22.

He plans to travel to Karachi on Nov. 26 to lay the foundation stone of Pakistan’s sixth nuclear power plant, which he said will produce 2,117 megawatts of electricity. China has helped Pakistan build two atomic reactors at Chashma in Punjab province, and is assisting with two more under construction at the same site. The new plant would be the second in Karachi. Sharif regained power for a record third time in a May election on a pledge to end chronic power shortages that have weighed on growth in the country’s $231 billion economy. The IMF approved a $6.6 billion loan in September for the South Asian nation to help stabilize the economy, which has also been hurt by a Taliban insurgency. Nuclear-armed Pakistan’s growing dependence on long-time ally China follows years of strained relations with the U.S. amid the war in Afghanistan and American drone attacks against Pakistani guerrillas in the country’s tribal areas. “Drone attacks on Pakistan are totally unacceptable,” Sharif said during the speech at the seminar.

Draghi’s outlook represented a change in policy for an institution whose officials had until then consistently said that it “never precommits” on monetary policy. “The euro area still faces considerable challenges” and “the economy is still weak,” Draghi said today. Still, recent confidence indicators “have shown some further improvement” and economic activity “should stabilize and recover over the course of the year, although at a subdued pace.” ‘Stable’ Conditions Draghi also said that the euro region faces an improved situation compared with a year earlier. “Clearly financial conditions in the euro area today are more stable and resilient than they were last summer,” he said. “This is partly due to our determined monetary policy actions. Governments and parliaments have also played a key role in the relative return of confidence and stability by undertaking courageous reforms.” In his opening statement to lawmakers, Draghi updated them on progress toward the creation of a program led by the European Investment Bank to stimulate lending to small and medium-sized companies, and on the ECB’s work to establish a banking supervisor. “Reinstating beyond doubt the soundness of the banking system, reintegrating the banking system and delivering a supervisory framework that will prevent a repeat of the past risk buildup” are among the ECB’s objectives, he said. “All core elements should fall into place swiftly to reap the full benefits of a banking union”')\n",

While teen birth rates have been falling in the U.S. for two decades, more than 367,000 girls ages 15 to 19 had children in 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report today. About 18 percent of those were repeat births, the Atlanta-based agency said. The analysis found that the repeat births are most common in a band of southern and western states -- Texas , Arkansas , Louisiana , Mississippi, Georgia , Oklahoma, Nevada and Arizona. Doctors and health-care professionals should discuss birth control with teenage patients and remind those who are sexually active to use condoms, the CDC said. “When young mothers postpone a second birth, they have greater educational and job opportunities,” Leslie Kantor, vice president of education at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. “The best way to prevent teen pregnancy across the board is by investing in effective sex education, encouraging teens to talk to their parents, and ensuring access to birth control.” Birth Control Only 20 percent of teenage mothers use the most effective birth control available, including hormonal implants and intrauterine devices or IUDs that don’t require daily maintenance, the CDC said. Even so, births among teenagers are waning. The agency said 19.5 percent of teenage births in 2007 were second children or more. “Teens, parents, health care providers, and others need to do much more to reduce unintended pregnancies,” Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC, said in a news release.

Every year of obesity raises the risk of developing coronary artery calcification, a silent predictor of heart disease with mild to no symptoms, by 2 percent to 4 percent, according to study published yesterday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. More than one third of U.S. adults ages 20 and older, and 17 percent of children and teenagers, are obese, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. About $147 billion a year is spent in the U.S. on obesity-related medical costs, according to a 2011 report. The study is the first to show that how long a person is obese can independently contribute to heart risk, said Jared Reis, the lead author. “What our study suggests is if we’re measuring only body mass index and waist circumference we may be underestimating the health risks of obesity by not measuring the duration,” Reis, an epidemiologist at the NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland , said in a telephone interview. Researchers looked at 3,275 adults ages 18 to 30 years who weren’t obese at the beginning of the study in the mid-1980s. Those in the study were given computed tomography scans to detect coronary artery calcification over 25 years. Their obesity and abdominal obesity also was measured. Study Data The researchers found that about 38 percent of those who were obese for more than 20 years and 39 percent of those who had abdominal obesity for that time developed coronary artery calcification compared with 25 percent of those who never became obese and never developed abdominal obesity. Those in the study who had obesity and abdominal obesity over two decades or more also had their coronary artery calcification progress in their heart. Obesity is measured using body mass index, or BMI, a calculation of weight and height. For example, a 5-foot, 4-inch woman weighing 175 pounds (80 kilograms) has a BMI of 30. BMI of 30 or more is considered obese, while a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight, according to the National Institutes of Health. Reis said researchers will continue following those in the study to see how many actually develop clinical heart disease.')\n",

Those steps would boost the shares and may draw the attention of potential bidders for Volcano. Pursue Sale “Volcano is a very attractive acquisition candidate for the large medical device players within the cardiac space,” Welling said. “We don’t believe they should sell themselves today. Once the stock is more fairly valued, and once they’ve achieved some of the targets,” it should pursue a sale. Volcano rose 7.1 percent to $20.29 at the close in New York.

The 39-year-old joins from Wigan Athletic, which last month became the first team to win the Cup and be relegated from the Premier League in the same season. “This is a phenomenal and a passionate football club,” Martinez said at a televised news conference after agreeing on a four-year contract. “Today, walking in at Goodison Park, it really feels like a special place for the future for me.” The Spaniard became Wigan manager in 2009, four years after it was promoted into the top flight. Wigan Chairman Dave Whelan said this week that he had agreed on a compensation deal with Everton for the release of Martinez, who’d been given permission to speak with the club. Everton will pay 1.5 million pounds ($2.3 million), according to the Daily Mail. Moyes achieved regular top-half finishes in the 20-team league in his 11 years at Everton.

Its last trophy was the F.A. Cup in 1995. “There is huge pressure but I am extremely proud of that pressure because it means what David Moyes did in 11 years is set high standards and lay an incredible platform,” Martinez said. “I feel lucky to be able to carry on that work.” Martinez moved to Wigan from Swansea, having represented both clubs in his playing career. The Latics finished no higher than 15th place during his tenure, but were able to avoid relegation in his first three seasons after late-season rallies. They weren’t able to pull another off this year and finished 18th in the 20-team league, three points from safety behind Sunderland. Relegation was confirmed with a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal, three days after Wigan upset Manchester City 1-0 to win the F.A.

The North African country scored 13 out of 100 in the 2012 survey, down from 49 in 2010, the Washington-based International Budget Partnership said in a report on its website. That places Egypt in the bottom one-fifth of the 100 nations surveyed, below Nigeria, Lebanon and Jordan. “The government provides the public with scant information on the national government’s budget and financial activities,” the group said in the report. “This makes it challenging for citizens to hold the government accountable for its management of the public’s money.” Egypt is seeking a $4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to plug a budget deficit that reached 10.8 percent of gross domestic product, or GDP, last year, according to official figures. The government is seeking to cut spending, especially on fuel subsidies, and raise taxes to cap this year’s deficit at 10.9 percent of GDP and then reduce it to 9.5 percent next year, according to an economic plan linked to the IMF loan. The widening deficit accompanies a plunge in foreign reserves and a slump in economic output as tourists and investors shunned Egypt amid recurring political tensions after Mubarak’s fall. The country’s benchmark dollar bonds plunged today, sending yields to 7.27 percent at 3 p.m. in Cairo, the highest since June. Document Release The IMF has often required borrower countries to make their budgets more transparent. The Partnership’s survey looks at whether eight key budget documents are made available to the public. In Egypt, only three were published, down from five in the 2010 assessment, the group said. The latest survey was researched in the second half of 2011 when an army-backed government was in power. The International Budget Partnership works with local groups around the world to advocate more transparent budgets, saying they are central to improving governance and reducing poverty.

(BA) ’s 787 Dreamliner, is optimistic about reaching an accord in 2013 over compensation for the jets’ grounding, its chief executive officer said. The 787’s setbacks created “tremendous pressure” for Warsaw-based LOT, and a Boeing settlement would be important for 2014 profitability, CEO Sebastian Mikosz said today in a meeting with reporters in New York. LOT reported daily losses of $50,000 from the worldwide grounding ordered by regulators in January when its first 787 was stranded in Chicago after the inaugural flight. The airline said it also found last week that two out of its five Dreamliners were missing oil filters. State-controlled LOT has bet on the all-composite 787 to cut costs and help restore profit. The carrier is replacing its long-haul fleet with the Dreamliner, whose lightweight materials and other technology help boost fuel efficiency. LOT suffered a fresh reverse on Sept. 29 when a 787 flying to Warsaw from Toronto had to land in Iceland after the failure of a system that identifies planes to air-traffic controllers. Two other jets were sent to retrieve passengers, and LOT flew the 787 home empty. That was a separate issue from the battery meltdowns on 787s flown by Japanese airlines that spurred the U.S. to order the first grounding of an entire model since 1979.

The craft has identified no methane on its sensors, and the greatest amount of the gas that may exist in the atmosphere is about 1.3 parts per billion, about six times lower than previous estimates made by earth-bound telescopes and orbiting satellites, according to a paper released today in the journal Science. Earth has about 1,800 parts per billion of methane in the atmosphere, said Chris Webster, a study author and the director of the microdevices lab at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California. The gas is mostly the result of the decay of organic matter, and a signal of biology. Higher readings of methane on Mars taken from Earth and orbiting satellites raised hopes that microbes might lie beneath the Martian surface, Webster said. “There aren’t significant amounts of methane, so that paints a whole different picture,” Webster said. “We can say that there isn’t significant microbial activity.” That doesn’t rule out the possibility that some microbes don’t produce methane, Webster said. The reading also doesn’t mean that life forms have never existed on Mars, he said. “Curiosity established that it was a habitable world about a billion or less years ago, with water flowing and energy --the right ingredients for simple life forms,” Webster said. Earlier Observations Some previous readings found plumes of methane , which appear to have dispersed, with as much as 45 parts per billion, Webster said. Another report, from an orbiter, said that it detected 10 parts per billion, plus or minus 5. Some scientists have criticizing the methods used to make those readings. “That’s in part because they’re very difficult observations,” Webster said. The sensor on Curiosity is more sensitive and doesn’t have to be read through Earth’s dense atmosphere, he said. Though Curiosity is measuring in only one place, the atmosphere on Mars mixes and turns over every few months, Webster said. So if there were a plume somewhere, it would mix to form the background atmosphere being analyzed by Curiosity.')\n",

Almost a year after investors were soothed by his promise to do “whatever it takes” to protect the euro, and a month since he cut interest rates , Draghi signaled on June 6 that governments, not the ECB, should do more to fight recession and boost credit to businesses in countries such as Spain. ‘Easiest’ Path “Fiscal consolidation in most countries has taken the shape of increasing taxes” which is “the easiest thing to do,” Draghi told reporters in Frankfurt in response to a question on the Spanish budget. “A better way would be the difficult way, namely to reduce unproductive government expenditure and reduce taxes together.” Spain’s budget deficit rose to a three-year high of 10.6 percent last year after the government agreed a 41 billion-euro ($55 billion) European rescue loan to clean up its banks. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA Chairma Francisco Gonzalez , who appeared on the same panel as Montoro, urged the government to complete the restructuring of the banking system as quickly as possible. “The financial reform will be finished when all institutions are in private hands and the financial system is functioning normally,” Gonzalez said. “We are on the right track.” He declined to speculate on whether Spanish banks may need more capital from the European Union before a review of Europe ’s banking system that the ECB is due to complete later this year.')\n",

Exxon Mobil Corp.

The project will produce 110,000 barrels per day later this year and that’s expected to double by late 2015, the company said in a statement. The Kearl site is 46 miles (75 km) northeast of Fort McMurray, Alberta, and is operated by Imperial (IMO) Oil Ltd., which is 70 percent owned by Exxon Mobil. “Kearl is a historic development for Imperial,” Richard Kruger, Imperial Oil’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “Kearl is the largest project we’ve ever undertaken and the beginning of a period of substantial growth for the company that will see us double production to more than 600,000 barrels per day by about 2020.” The C$12.9 billion Kearl project has been beset by equipment transport and weather delays, along with rising costs. In February, Imperial raised its estimate for initial costs due to “harsh weather” and issues delivering equipment to the site near the Saskatchewan border. Montana residents protested the truck traffic that made its way through the state en route to Alberta. Imperial started production yesterday, said Pius Rolheiser, a spokesman for the company, in a telephone interview from Calgary today.

Net income at Calgary-based Imperial dropped to C$798 million, or C$0.94 cents, on revenue of C$8.01 billion. Earnings per share fell 1 cent short of the C$0.95-cent average from 12 analysts. Imperial plans to avoid the impact of selling Kearl’s output at lower prices for oil-sands crude relative to the U.S. benchmark by transporting it to refineries owned by Imperial and Exxon, Kruger said April 25. Imperial also is looking to secure rail cars for transporting some of the crude, to avoid a pipeline shortage from western Canada that’s depressing prices.')\n",

Lula and Iara are located on the same exploration block and are part of the so-called pre-salt region, discovered by Petrobras in 2007 when it found crude trapped under a layer of salt below the Atlantic seabed. Growing pre-salt output helped both BG and Galp beat earnings estimates in the first quarter. Petrobras’s press office didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment. The Rio-based company said May 13 that it may “use special techniques for stimulation and well geometry” at Iara.

The shares advanced 1.5 percent to 469.99, the highest since June 19, and giving the Johannesburg-based company a market value of 151.4 billion rand ($16 billion). That pared Kumba Iron Ore’s decline this year to 17 percent, compared with a 4.9 percent increase in the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share index. Kumba will pay an interim dividend of 20.10 rand a share, up from 19.20 rand last year, the Pretoria-based company said in a statement today. It has made payouts in every six-month reporting period since the start of trading in 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “It keeps churning out a dividend,” Albert Minassian, a Cape Town-based analyst at Investec Ltd., said today by phone. The payout “had skepticism around it for a good three years,” with investors concerned that it would be smaller, he said. Kumba’s first-half profit rose after production from a new mine and the rand’s weakness against the dollar countered output losses from strikes and a decline in prices, it said. In May, iron ore slumped into a bear market on concern that slowing economic growth in China , the world’s biggest buyer, will reduce demand as global supplies increase. Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin , the benchmark price, traded at an average of $136.97 a ton in the six months through June, 2.6 percent lower than the mean a year earlier, according to The Steel Index Ltd. in China, where the ore’s moisture can account for 8 percent to 10 percent of its weight. The price has fallen 9.2 percent so far this year. The company will maintain its payment cover of 1.2 times, Chief Executive Officer Norman Mbazima told reporters in a conference call. “We’ve always said we’re going to return money to our shareholders when we make money,” Mbazima said. “Until our projects move further along their development and we are more certain about expansion capital, we’ll continue to return money to shareholders.”')\n",

United’s Shares reservation system didn’t cause the fault, she said, without giving further details. “For a time, we closed the booking engine on United.com so we could correct the error,” McCarthy said. The website was back to normal at about 2:30 p.m. Chicago time, she said. Many of the tickets cost $5 or $10 in total, suggesting that United was only collecting a mandatory 9/11 security fee of $2.50 per leg, said Rick Seaney , chief executive officer of FareCompare.com, a ticket research firm based in Dallas. Taxes and fees typically add up to $22 or more a ticket, he said.

Emirates took delivery of six Airbus SAS double-decker A380s and three of Boeing’s current-generation 777s in the six months, adding more than 4,000 seats, plus a sole 777 freighter, swelling what were already the biggest fleets of the two models. Stockholm, Boston The passenger total rose 15 percent to 21.5 million, while the load factor -- a measure of seat occupancy -- was barely changed at 79.2 percent. The Gulf carrier, which has exploited Dubai’s geographical position to turn its home base into a hub for intercontinental travel linking Europe and the Americas with the Asia-Pacific and Africa, is scheduled to take delivery of a further 15 aircraft before the end of its financial year next March. Emirates added five destinations in the first half -- Tokyo Haneda, Stockholm , Clark airport in the Philippines , Conakry in Guinea and Sialkot in Pakistan -- and plans to open up routes including Kiev, Taipei, Kabul and Boston in the current period. As of September, the carrier served 133 cities with 205 planes. Earnings at the main airline unit rose 2 percent to 1.75 billion dirhams amid what Sheikh Ahmed said is a “challenging” global business environment. Fuel costs remain high, accounting for 39 percent of spending, and unfavorable exchange rates “continue to eat into our profits,” he said. Ground-handling unit Dnata boosted earnings 13 percent to 458 million dirhams.

But an online video service from Stockholm has a new feature that encourages it. Voddler , which has attracted more than 1 million users in the Nordic region and Spain, is going global with a service starting Thursday that lets users legally share movies and shows that they rent or buy with as many as 10 friends. So an online movie rented for 48 hours can also be viewed by friends during that span, and a film bought from Voddler can be watched by friends whenever. Users can also upload flicks from other sources, such as iTunes, Amazon.com or even their own DVD libraries, and share those. The entertainment industry has long sought ways to curb illegal downloading of its movies, music and games. It hasn\\'t been easy. After more than a decade, the record industry\\'s revenue grew for the first time last year as more consumers used streaming services and downloaded licensed music. Voddler\\'s sharing feature, called LiveShelf, costs about $5 to $6 a month. The company gives some of that revenue to the content producers. \"Sharing is natural and our digital shelf is the first legal service that encourages this behavior,\" Voddler Chief Executive Marcus Baecklund said in an interview. \"People won\\'t have to resort to piracy anymore.\" We\\'ll see. The sharing feature aside, there will always be those who don\\'t want to pay for content. The Nordic region, with its high broadband penetration and limited and expensive pay-TV offerings, has emerged as an online-video battleground as local services such as Voddler and ViaPlay have taken on Netflix and Amazon.

Dr. Zuroff, the Nazi hunter in question, has responded in the comments. He writes: I’m aware, of course, that Nazi hunts continue. But surely, they cannot go on much longer, since not only the men, but also the witnesses are rapidly dying off. Assigning a plausible age to the younger criminals -- say, someone who was 20 in 1942 -- puts even the very youngest in their early 90s. Only 11 percent of the men born in the U.S. in 1922 are still alive, and the longevity for a European who lived through World War II is much lower. Those who are alive today can expect to live less than four years more. There are of course outliers. But the fact remains, we’re looking at the joint probability of two events that are themselves becoming more unlikely: uncovering a Nazi decades after he discarded his identity, and that Nazi being alive. The odds that the ones you uncover will be the ones who are still alive is necessarily much smaller than the already unlikely individual events. Which is not to say that this quest is somehow unnecessary. I believe fervently in bringing Nazis to justice; I’m just not sure that it can be accomplished for much longer.

Crude has been trading in Houston for $4 a barrel less than Brent as new pipelines and increased Texas crude production have boosted supply in the city while takeaway capacity remains limited, according to Adam Longson, a commodity strategy research analyst for Morgan Stanley (MS) in New York. Light Louisiana Sweet crude, the benchmark light, sweet oil on the U.S. Gulf Coast, increased 3 cents to a $1.36-a-barrel premium over Brent at 4:08 p.m. in New York. The crude is priced in St. James, Louisiana. Based on that spread and the the Morgan Stanley estimate, crude in Houston is about $5 to $6 under Louisiana. Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) Chief Executive Officer Bill Klesse said in a first-quarter earnings call April 30 that the discount for crude in Houston versus Louisiana was about $1 to $2 a barrel. Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP) started its Longhorn pipeline to Houston from West Texas in mid-April at 75,000 barrels a day, and plans to expand to 135,000 by late May. Sunoco Logistics Partners LP (SXL) expects to begin shipping crude to Houston from West Texas on the Permian Express pipeline in June. “Houston lacks a benchmark, but physical traders indicate Houston is already pricing about $4/bbl under Brent, given physical limitations in moving crude out of the area,” Longson said in his note. “Houston regional pricing will only erode further as more crude reaches the area.” Incoming Supply Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) and Enbridge Inc.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) reversed part of its Ho-Ho pipeline to carry crude from Houston to the Port Arthur area in January. The company plans to complete the reversal project to move crude to Louisiana refineries by the end of the year. “Capacity to bring incremental crude to St. James is limited (pipeline, rail and barge), suggesting LLS will continue to trade well above Houston pricing, even after the Ho-Ho pipeline reversal later in 2013,” Longson said.

The Dutch government could only support euro bonds as one of the final touches on a bolstered economic and monetary union, he said. “We’re really talking about the distant future.” The prospect of common euro-area debt issuance fell off the European agenda indefinitely last year under pressure from Germany as Chancellor Angela Merkel , an opponent of joint bonds, prepared for an election later this year. In their place, European Union President Herman Van Rompuy proposed the exploration of a “common but limited” euro budget after 2014.

When finance ministers meet on Jan. 21 in Brussels, Dijsselbloem said he’ll provide his view on the group’s “agenda and functioning,” not his vision for the future of the euro.

(7751) and Hitachi Ltd. (6501) among others. Myanmar, which has $11 billion in overdue debt from decades of military rule, owes the most to Japan. Japan has sought closer ties since the 2010 election that brought President Thein Sein to power, hosting him in Tokyo last year and having Prime Minister Shinzo Abe travel to Myanmar in May in the first visit by a Japanese leader for 36 years. During the visit, Abe offered new loans to Myanmar and approved plans made last year to settle the nation’s $6.6 billion debt to Japan. Thilawa Hub The Thilawa hub will initially occupy 400 hectares (988 acres). The space may be enough to house 50 firms to 100 firms spanning a wide range of light manufacturing, Kabeya said.

(PFE) ’s rheumatoid arthritis pill failed to win the backing of European drug regulators, who said the drug already approved in the U.S. isn’t effective enough against the condition. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, recommended that Pfizer’s pill Xeljanz not be approved for sale, the New York-based drugmaker said today in a statement. The drug gained marketing clearance in the U.S. in November. “Pfizer intends to appeal this opinion and immediately seek a re-examination of the opinion by the CHMP,” the company said. The committee decided the drug didn’t show a favorable risk versus benefit profile, Pfizer said. Xeljanz inhibits part of the immune system that can cause rheumatoid arthritis. The first of a new type of therapies for the disease, the pill is one of Pfizer’s top new products. If approved in Europe , it may generate sales of $510 million there by 2018, according to Mark Schoenebaum , an analyst with International Strategy & Investment Group in New York. The medicine would compete with AbbVie Inc.’s Humira (ABBV) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s Remicade. “Pfizer will appeal, but history teaches that odds are against them,” Schoenebaum said today in a note to clients. More data might help Pfizer on appeal, which may take six months, he said. Comittee’s View The European regulators said the drug didn’t show enough effectiveness in reducing the disease’s activity in the body or slowing damage to joints, even though it improved symptoms, Pfizer said. There were also concerns about side effects including tumors and infections. The European Commission usually adopts the committee’s advice, though it isn’t required to do so. Pfizer shares declined 2.4 percent to $29.53 in extended trading at 5:50 p.m. New York time after the announcement.

The London-based lender invested 612 million euros in Romania last year, part of 6.4 billion euros it has spent there since the 1990s, James Hyslop , the EBRD’s country manager for Romania, said in an interview in Bucharest yesterday. “We had a very strong year in Romania and we still have a few significant projects to close,” Hyslop said. “I would certainly envisage that if we did 600 million euros last year, we’re doing about the same amount this year, and we should be doing 400 to 500 to 600 million euros next year.” Romania, the European Union’s second-poorest member in output per capita, is the EBRD’s fourth-largest recipient of funds after Russia , Poland , and Ukraine, according to the bank’s website. The development bank has lent 3 billion euros in the country of 21 million people over the last five years to support its transformation from a former-communist state to a market-driven democracy, Hyslop said. The EBRD, which bought a 1.9 percent stake in natural-gas producer Romgaz SA through Romania’s biggest initial public offering ever last week, may participate in other asset sales planned by the government, Hyslop said. Romania plans to sell a 15 percent stake in hydropower generator Hidroelectrica SA and a majority stake in energy distributor Electrica SA by June. Future Listings “Romgaz was a test case for future listings in 2014,” Hyslop said. “There’s domination by the state in the energy sector, so it’s extremely important to increase private sector participation in these core energy assets.” The EBRD bought 2 percent of Romanian oil and gas company OMV Petrom SA in 2004, according to its website.

Credit availability, pent-up demand and an improving U.S. economy are reasons “still in place” to drive a sales increase this year, he said. Toyota (7203) Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Chrysler last year led U.S. vehicle sales to their highest annual total in half a decade as the two Japan-based automakers restored production that was disrupted a year earlier by Japan ’s tsunami.

U.S. auto sales may climb to 15.1 million this year, the average of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of analysts this month. The industry is benefiting from consumers replacing cars and trucks that are the oldest ever on U.S. roads, at almost 11 years on average, according to researchers R.L. Polk & Co. and Experian Automotive. “The average age of the fleet on U.S. roads of a car is right around 11 years -- they don’t last forever,” said Bigland, 45, who declined to give a specific forecast for 2013 U.S. industry sales.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts inventories to reach a record in 2013-2014. “China’s demand for cooking oil has stabilized, even as soybean imports continue to grow to satisfy the need for protein feed for livestock,” Liu Xianwu, the general manager of Beijing-based researcher China Cereals & Oils Business Net, said yesterday. “There’s steady demand for the cheaper palm oil, but fundamentally it’s not changing much.” Palm oil for delivery in January fell for the first time in three days on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, declining as much as 0.3 percent and traded at 2,434 ringgit ($766) at 1:29 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.

Refined palm oil for May delivery declined 0.5 percent to 6,124 yuan ($1,005) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange and soybean oil retreated 0.7 percent to 7,208 yuan.

The pay rules were a late addition to wide-ranging EU legislation on how it will apply global rules to strengthen bank capital requirements. Ireland, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, pledged to iron out final elements of an agreement in coming weeks, even as Osborne said he “can’t support the proposal currently on the table.” Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged a referendum on the U.K. staying in the EU if he’s re-elected in 2015. Carswell said he doesn’t expect the bonus proposals will cut bankers’ remuneration. “All we’re going to see is a barrier against management rewarding good performance,” the Tory lawmaker said. “If Europe was the only part of the planet that did financial services, perhaps this measure wouldn’t really matter. But in an age where it’s very simple for banks to relocate and we’re competing with Dubai, New York, Singapore , I think this is another example of the euro elite imposing a very destructive measure that will actually lead Europe in aggregate to be much worse off.” Carswell said the proposal raises “fundamental questions” about whether Britain should remain part of the EU. “I think many in the City of London will now be open to the suggestion that we should leave,” he said.')\n",

You have to be prepared to be quite transparent, both in terms of scenarios you are using and the results.” The Fed is stress-testing the largest banks and has set up teams to look for risks across financial markets and institutions, switching to a more industry-wide approach from one that looked at banks individually, while the European Central Bank is preparing a similar set of tests before it takes over supervision of euro-area banks next year. Clark, a senior associate director in the Fed’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, said today that the central bank’s key objective is to make sure banks can withstand financial turbulence. The goal is for banks “to be able to withstand stress and be able to come out the other side able to function,” he said.

Cyprus is seeking leeway under a 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) rescue that euro area and the International Monetary Fund granted in March in return for losses on uninsured depositors in the country’s two largest lenders. The Cypriot government imposed capital controls as it resolved the second-biggest lender, Cyprus Popular Bank Pcl. Anastasiades said in a June 6 letter to European Commission President Jose Barroso that the rescue package imposed losses on bank depositors “without careful preparation,” creating “pressing issues that need to be addressed.” A significant number of Cypriot firms have lost their working capital, Anastasiades said. In his letter, Anastasiades said Bank of Cyprus Pcl’s absorption of parts of Cyprus Popular, including a 9 billion-euro liability from the central bank’s Emergency Liquidity Assistance program, had created a “mega-systemic bank.” The success of Cyprus’s bailout program depends on the emergence of a “strong and viable” Bank of Cyprus, he said.

The Fed’s first step may be to trim its monthly debt purchases in September by $10 billion to $75 billion, according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey completed last week. “The Treasury market is pricing in September tapering to the full,” said Makoto Suzuki, a senior bond strategist at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. “A moderate recovery is continuing in the U.S. economy .” U.S. 10-year yields were little changed today at 2.87 percent as of 10 a.m. in Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.

Specifically, residential fixed investment and consumer spending on durable goods. If you look at year-over-year changes to remove quarterly noise, residential investment was up 15.3 percent in the third quarter while spending on durables rose 7.6 percent. These two sectors typically lead the business cycle because they are interest-rate sensitive. Hence, the heavy weight -- five of 10 components -- given to manufacturing and housing in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators despite their small share of the economy. Housing was slow out of the gate this time because of the detritus from the burst bubble, mainly foreclosed homes and bad mortgage loans. But it's been carrying its weight the last two years, with average annualized quarterly increases of 14.5 percent. What about everything else? While real GDP increased 2.8 percent in the third quarter, inventories accounted for almost a third of the growth. Consumer spending added 1 percentage point and net exports 0.3 percentage point. Real final sales, which is GDP less inventories, rose 2 percent, close to the trend since the recession ended in June 2009. Final sales to domestic purchasers, which excludes exports and includes imports, rose a meager 1.7 percent. So there you have it. Almost five years of zero-percent interest rates, about $3 trillion of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve and lots of forward guidance on both, and the U.S. economy still can't get out of its own way. Whatever else the Fed decides, tapering asset purchases isn't in the cards any time soon. (Caroline Baum is a Bloomberg View columnist. Follow her on Twitter.)\")\n",

Some banks have responded and some have not.” On monsoon rains and monetary policy: “Among other things, the RBI also watches monsoon movement because our economic conditions, particularly the economic conditions of the poorer segments of the population, are determined by the behavior of the monsoon because that determines the agricultural output and the rural economy.

Second-quarter sales growth had slowed because of “lower-than-expected end product sell-through at some key customers,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Hickey said in a statement today. “We expect this to continue to impact revenue over the next few months, as customer inventory is run down.” Wolfson, based in Edinburgh, signed a deal with Suwon, South-Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co.

Samsung second-quarter earnings then missed analyst estimates and the company predicted that growth in the smartphone market would slow in the next three months. “Even adjusting for the Samsung slowdown, the numbers came out worse than I’d expected,” Pia Tapley, a London-based analyst at N+1 Singer Ltd, said in a phone interview. Wolfson may have suffered from generating more than 70 percent of its revenue in Europe and Asia “where weakness has been previously flagged in the industry,” N+1 Singer said in a note to investors.

Tallow shipments from the U.S. may decline to 680,000 metric tons in 2013 from 706,000 tons last year, the Hamburg-based industry researcher wrote in an e-mailed report. They’ve dropped from a record 1.32 million tons in 1998, Oil World said. Tallow is a by-product of beef production, meaning supply is not price sensitive, according to the report. Use of the fat to make biodiesel jumped 60 percent in the past two years, requiring demand rationing in chemistry and for edible purposes. “Virtually stagnating world supplies and the increasing consumption from the biodiesel industry have considerably squeezed supplies available for other consumers,” Oil World said. “We expect this trend to continue in 2014, keeping tallow prices well supported.” Tallow prices are expected to average $1,050 a ton this year in Rotterdam, down from $1,085 in 2012, Oil World said. They’ve more than doubled from $446 a ton in 1998, according to the researcher. World usage of tallow to make biodiesel rose to 1.6 million tons last year from 1 million tons in 2010, according to Oil World. With rising consumption by biodiesel makers, tallow production has been insufficient and prices have been “unusually high” since 2011, the researcher wrote. Singapore has become an important consumer and is forecast to lift tallow imports to 250,000 tons from 158,000 tons in 2012, from “virtually zero” five years ago, according to the report.

The timing was sooner than expected, and a positive for Pfizer because it should add to earnings next year, he said. The exchange also advances Read’s effort of cutting Pfizer’s shares outstanding and boosting earnings per share through moves including stock buybacks. Better Position “Given the strong demand in the IPO and a favorable market environment, we concluded that now is the appropriate time to distribute our remaining stake in Zoetis,” Read said in today’s statement.

He\\'s right: Quits show the employee\\'s confidence that he or she can find a better job. There\\'s a counterpoint, though. The rate of labor market \"churn\" -- the number of people moving from job to job per quarter -- dropped by 2.3 million during the recession and hasn\\'t recovered. That\\'s the conclusion of a study last year by economists Edward Lazear and James Spletzer, who broke down labor-market activity into \"growth hires,\" \"declining separations\" and \"churn.\" Lazear and Spletzer emphasize the particular importance of churn. Companies rise and fall, but churn plays a central role in the efficient operation of labor markets. Robert M. Kimmitt, a former U.S. Treasury deputy secretary, made the case for churn back in 2007. Kimmitt wrote that what we want is \"an economy in which people looking to move up have as many opportunities as possible from which to choose.\" Low churn means that people may be choosing to hold down jobs that aren\\'t quite right for them. The average job change produces a $1,000 productivity gain, according to Lazear and Spletzer, who found a total cost of $208 billion since 2008. We can approximate their measure of churn by looking at a slightly different yardstick, the total flow in and out of employment in today\\'s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data. The report showed that 8.7 million Americans found a job or left one in April -- down 2 million from pre-recession levels. Why the decline? Blame weak demand for labor. That clogs up the cycle of job openings, hires, fires and quits. You have to be brave to leave a job amid high unemployment and little hiring -- but with few quitters, positions don\\'t open up and so the low churn persists. The flipside of low churn is extended periods of joblessness. The average unemployed person waits 37 weeks before finding work. That measure hasn\\'t improved significantly since the recession. Before it, workers on average landed a job in 17 weeks. To jumpstart churn, the U.S. economy needs more \"growth hires.\" The Federal Reserve, in particular, should pay attention: It has promised to wait for \"substantial\" improvement in labor markets before scrapping its bond-buying program. The Fed is watching the unemployment rate, but its statements indicate it also considers \"additional measures of labor market conditions.\" Churn should be one of those. The ultimate task of labor markets is to allocate workers to positions -- and churn measures that directly. That it hasn\\'t improved since the recession means that labor markets are much less healthy than falling unemployment might suggest. (Evan Soltas is a contributor to the Ticker.

It also improves border security and verification of immigrant worker status, while increasing visas for skilled workers, she said. “This is a good bipartisan solution, and I look forward to supporting it,” said Ayotte, who was elected from New Hampshire in 2010 with support from the Tea Party movement. Ayotte’s backing puts the legislation, which would be the most sweeping changes in the nation’s immigration law in a generation, closer to the 60-vote threshold needed for Senate consideration. The chamber is scheduled to continue debate on the measure this week and Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, has said he wants the legislation completed before the July 4 congressional recess. The legislation would try to balance a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, sought by Democrats, with enough border-security improvements to satisfy Republicans.

New York has 7,700 bus routes. Job security “is directly linked to the safety and security of our children by ensuring the city’s most qualified, skilled and experienced school bus crews remain on the job,” Michael Cordiello, president of Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union , said at a Manhattan news briefing. Job protection has been part of contracts for more than 30 years, he said. Additional transit police, school-safety officers and crossing guards will be deployed to help students reach classrooms, Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott said. The largest U.S. public-school system has already told parents it would offer free MetroCards to pay subway and bus fares for students as well as for parents of preschoolers and those with special needs. Parents also will be reimbursed if they need to drive or hire a car to bring children to school. Court Barrier A decision by the Court of Appeals, the state’s highest tribunal, prohibits the city from offering job security and seniority to bus drivers who aren’t New York employees, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said. “We have told the unions in unequivocal terms: Do not walk out on our students,” Bloomberg said yesterday at City Hall. “A strike would be not only unfair to children and families, it would be totally misguided because the city cannot legally offer what the unions are demanding.” Richard Gilberg, a union lawyer, said the court limited its ruling to circumstances where one could show no benefit in hiring experienced drivers. Bus service costs have skyrocketed to $1.1 billion a year from $100 million in 1979, with the city spending an average of $6,900 per bused student, more than any district in the country, Bloomberg said.

Shares jumped earlier after Offshore.no, an oil-industry website, said Jette is producing at about 21,000 barrels a day, citing an unidentified person. Output at that rate would have been double expectations, Alex Gheorghe, an analyst at RS Platou Markets AS, said in an e-mail. “The news is positive since the project was written off last year, and management has previously disclosed it’s unlikely it will recover costs,” Gheorghe wrote. “We expect the stock to outperform by about 1 to 2 kroner a share.” Detnor is transforming itself from an exploration company into an oil producer as pumping begins at fields including Jette and Ivar Aasen, scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company took a 1.9 billion kroner ($329 million) writedown on Jette in the third quarter after technical problems with a production well. “Jette is a small field and there are uncertainties with respect to future production rates,” Detnor said today. The company has a 70 percent stake in Jette, while Petoro AS, which manages Norway ’s direct stakes in its oil and gas assets, has the remaining 30 percent. Shares in Detnor have more than tripled in the last two years after finds including Johan Sverdrup, which could hold as much as 3.6 billion barrels of oil, making it the biggest discovery off Norway since 1974. Detnor has stakes in two of the three licenses containing Sverdrup.')\n",

(SAFM) , the third- largest U.S. chicken processor, said the removal of food-safety inspectors because of federal budget cuts set to go into effect next week would disrupt its operations. The company is prohibited by law from operating poultry- processing plants without the presence of federal inspectors and would have to shut plants in their absence, Laurel, Mississippi- based Sanderson said in a filing today. The closing of plants owned by Sanderson, a supplier to grocery chains Kroger Co. and Supervalu Inc., would be one of the effects of the automatic U.S. federal budget cuts set to begin March 1 unless President Barack Obama and Congress work out a deal to avoid or postpone them. “Without proper notice, that would be a terrible situation for us,” Joe Sanderson Jr., the company’s chairman and chief executive officer, said today on a call with analysts to discuss fiscal first-quarter earnings. The USDA is considering furloughing inspectors for 15 days as part of automatic U.S. federal budget cuts, known as sequestration. The move could spur the “first widespread shortage” of meat, poultry and egg products in generations, according to a letter sent to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on Feb. 11 by three dozen trade groups from across the country. Mortality Rates A 15-day furlough resulting from the cuts could cost more than $10 billion in production losses and industry workers could lose more than $400 million in wages, Vilsack said in a Feb. 5 letter to Senator Barbara Mikulski, chairwoman of the appropriations committee. The USDA is responsible for the safety of meat, eggs and poultry products with about 8,400 personnel inspecting the nation’s 6,300 slaughterhouses and processing plants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration handles other products that account for about 80 percent of the U.S. food supply. Sanderson said live chickens would likely experience “significantly higher mortality” because of higher weights, and the company’s inability to process chickens at plants for an extended period “would materially disrupt” operations and product delivery. The possible cuts also may change the delivery and cash- settlement mechanisms of some livestock and dairy products traded in Chicago , the CME Group Inc. said in a statement on its website yesterday. The cuts could disrupt USDA reports used in the daily calculation of the CME feeder cattle and lean hog indexes and monthly calculations used to determine settlement prices for dairy futures products, according to the statement.

Raw sugar for loading next month at the port of Santos, Brazil’s biggest, last traded at a premium of 0.15 cent a pound to the price of the March contract on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange in New York, the Rolle, Switzerland-based company said in a report e-mailed yesterday. That compares with a premium of 0.1 cent a pound on Jan. 30, data from the broker showed. Higher premiums are pointing to “tightness in Brazil supply during their intercrop, and unquestionably coming from regular demand from the Middle East refineries,” said Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar Brokers. Demand is also gaining because of lower futures prices and sales to Far East, he said. Sugar futures, which fell 39 percent in the past two years, are down 6.5 percent this year as supplies are set to outpace demand by 6.2 million metric tons in the 2012-13 season started in October in most countries, the International Sugar Organization in London estimates. In Brazil’s center south, the country’s main growing region, harvesting of the 2012-13 crop ended, with sugar production at 34.1 million tons, data from industry group Unica showed. The new crop will start being gathered in April. Brazilian raw sugar for loading in April was at a premium of about 0.2 cent a pound to the exchange price, up from 0.08 cent on Jan. 30, data from the broker showed. For loading this month, the sweetener was at a discount of 0.05 cent a pound, unchanged from Jan. 30, according to Swiss Sugar Brokers. Asian Demand “A combination of strong Asian demand (mostly Indonesia) and port congestion from soy helped Brazilian raws strengthen further,” Tom McNeill , a director at Brisbane, Australia-based researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty. said in a separate report e-mailed today.

For the 12 months ending March 31, the unit of JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) will receive 20 billion yen ($226 million) of orders for boilers using wood, sewage sludge and garbage to produce power, compared with a June forecast of 10 billion yen, Managing Director Masumi Sekiguchi said during an interview in Tokyo. The unit expects similar orders next year, he said. “We’ve got so many inquiries that well surpassed our production capacity,” Sekiguchi said in the Jan. 15 interview. “We are unable to respond to all of them.” The surge in orders shows burgeoning interest in biomass as an alternative source of power following the introduction of a feed-in tariff program last year that pays renewable-energy generators above-market rates for their output. A government task force in September forecast that tapping Japan’s unused biomass -- including food waste and timber produced by thinning out forests -- could produce enough electricity to serve 4.6 million households. JFE Engineering plans to design, construct and operate two biomass power plants in the western and eastern regions of Japan, one of which is to start operations in 2015 as part of a marketing push and as a way to add a stable revenue source by selling power, the executive said. The company set up a biomass business department in April. Biomass Investments Oji Holdings Corp. (3861) , the world’s biggest user of renewable energy and Japan’s biggest producer of paper products, and Sumitomo Osaka Cement Co. (5232) are among Japanese companies that plan to sell clean power in Japan as domestic demand for their mainstay products stagnates. Japan introduced the feed-in tariff incentive program on July 1 to help cut the reliance on atomic power after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011. JFE Engineering’s boilers are designed to operate using as much as 80 percent of their fuel source from unused wood and the rest from other materials such as palm shell, waste plastic and coal, according to Sekiguchi. Japan will add 90,000 kilowatts of biomass capacity by the end of March, bringing the total to 2.19 million kilowatts or 4.3 percent more than the previous year, according to a Dec. 14 estimate by Japan’s trade ministry.')\n",

The Fed could try to boost inflation to its 2 percent goal by maintaining the policy, he said. The central bank is currently purchasing assets at “a torrid pace, and I’d rather get out of it if we can, but I’d like to meet our goals,” he said. Price gains have been lagging behind Fed policy makers’ target, and the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, rose 1.2 percent in August. In their October statement, members of the policy making Federal Open Market Committee said inflation “persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance,” projecting that inflation will move back toward the objective over the medium term. The FOMC in October decided to press on with bond purchases, awaiting further signs the economy will grow quickly enough to bring down 7.2 percent unemployment. Economists had originally expected a taper in Septemeber. Now, the median projection in a Bloomberg survey projects that scaling back will begin in March. Fed Constrained Bullard, who voted for the October decision, called bond buying “conventional” policy when the Fed is constrained by near-zero interest rates, and said “it’s a very reasonable thing to do to substitute for the fact that you can’t lower interest rates any further.” Bullard also said the pace of monetary easing is “too experimental” for policy makers to make its direction totally obvious to onlookers. “Ideally, we’d like to have a policy rule for quantitative easing, where you could show how we react to variables in the economy,” Bullard said. “The truth is, we’ve never been able to get to that. It’s too experimental of a policy, we just don’t have enough experience with it to get to that point. But that would be the sort of Holy Grail on this.” Bullard, 52, has been an advocate of an open-ended approach to bond buying, and has urged the Fed to hold off on adjusting bond purchases, saying any change should depend on whether inflation moves toward the Fed’s target. Bullard joined the St. Louis Fed’s research department in 1990 and became president of the regional bank in 2008.

Some in predominantly Sunni Egypt are uneasy over improving relations between the regional powerhouses, which recently renewed ties ruptured more than three decades ago. Ultraconservative Sunni Salafis say the rapprochement will give Iran an opportunity to spread its Shiite Muslim ideology in Egypt. Minister Hisham Zazou said the flights would be halted temporarily so he could open a dialogue with the Salafis. “It’s a chance for me as a minister to begin consultations with political groups and parties, especially with Salafis who opposed the decision” to renew the flights, Zazou said today in a phone interview. The Iranian agent organizing the flights said she had not been notified of the decision, the state-run Iranian Student News Agency reported. The two countries severed ties in 1979 after the Islamic Revolution and Egypt’s peace treaty with Israel.

Here is some of what I\\'ve been reading this afternoon while watching the markets go down. Hamptons excess back to being excessive The wealthy enclaves of Long Island, New York, called the Hamptons have fully rebounded -- and then some.

One of its first assignments will be an asset-quality review focusing on banks\\' loans. Patrick Jenkins of the Financial Times writes: \"Properly done, the exercise could quickly establish the ECB as a tough regulator and help restore investor faith in Europe’s lenders. A succession of botched stress tests over recent years and laggardly recapitalization of troubled lenders have deterred investors from backing the sector.\" The real test will be if the ECB has the guts to try telling Deutsche Bank what to do. Angela Merkel blames her predecessor (who is from a different political party, of course) for Europe\\'s debt crisis It\\'s election season in Germany, and the country\\'s leader is in full campaign mode. \"For example, Greece shouldn\\'t have been allowed into the euro\" in 2001, Merkel told supporters at a rally in Rendsberg. “Chancellor [Gerhard] Schroeder accepted Greece in and weakened the Stability Pact, and both decisions were fundamentally wrong, and one of the starting points for our current troubles.” Jack Lew\\'s letter to Congress on the debt ceiling Here we go again. The U.S. will hit the debt ceiling in mid-October, the Treasury secretary said. \"Operating the government with no borrowing authority, and with only the cash on hand on a given day, would place the United States in an unacceptable position,\" Lew said.

Outstanding local-currency debt in the region rose 12 percent to $6.5 trillion in 2012, and increased foreign participation has reduced yields, the Manila-based lender said in its quarterly Asia Bond Monitor released today. Authorities have taken measures to curb inflows, with Taiwan’s central bank telling lawmakers in a March 15 report that global “hot money” has overtaken economic fundamentals in determining the direction of Asian currency and stock markets. “These developments might put upward pressure on exchange rates, making exports less competitive,” the ADB said in the report led by Thiam Hee Ng, senior economist at its regional economic integration office in Manila. “There are concerns that higher levels of liquidity could lead to excess credit growth, thus fueling asset-price bubbles in the region.” Six of the region’s currencies are among the top 10 performers among emerging markets in the past year, led by advances of 5.8 percent for the Philippine peso and 4.3 percent for Thailand’s baht. Yuan positions at local lenders accumulated from sales of foreign exchange to the central bank, an indicator of cross-border inflows to China, rose a record 684 billion yuan ($110 billion) in January, official data showed March 5.

The order, valued at about $20 billion at list price, was signed today as the Dubai Air Show. The aircraft will serve both a replacement and growth purpose, Emirates said. The transaction is a record for the A380, which was at risk of ending 2013 without a deal. Instead, Airbus can now make the year the most successful for its superjumbo should leasing company Doric firm up its plan to buy 20 units, which it announced in June. Emirates is already the biggest customer for the Airbus flagship with orders for 90 jets and had taken delivery of 38 by the end of October. The boost comes after Airbus Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said Nov. 14 that the Toulouse, France-based company may need to examine whether to reduce A380 output, with unsold production slots as early as 2015. Emirates was also the buyer of the prior record purchase, committing to taking 32 jets at the Berlin Air Show in 2010. With the additional purchase, the Middle Eastern carrier would have signed for more than 50 percent of all A380s sold. Customers typically get discounts to list prices. The planemaker was bracing for a third straight year in which it failed to meet order targets after Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) canceled a commitment to take three aircraft in September. Airbus had a backlog of 144 planes at the end of last month. Airbus is reversing a string of A380 setbacks after Air France-KLM (AF) Group, Europe ’s largest carrier, followed Lufthansa’s cancellations by saying it may drop two superjumbos for smaller planes. Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. has said it can’t be sure to take any of its six A380s on order, while Japan ’s Skymark Airlines Inc.

It was the worst performer in the Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index , which was little changed. The decline took the share’s drop this year to 32 percent and its market capitalization to 4.15 billion euros ($5.4 billion). Raiffeisen’s Austrian competitor Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) today completed a 661 million-euro share sale to help repay state aid and to lift its core Tier 1 ratio according to the new Basel III rules beyond 10 percent. That deal increases the pressure on Raiffeisen to follow suit, Berenberg said. “We lower our price target from 22 euros to 12 euros to factor in an imminent equity issue at a material discount,” London-based analysts Eleni Papoula and Iro Papadopoulou said in the note. “The equity raise by Erste in July and regulator pressure will force Raiffeisen also to raise 1.7 billion euros to 2 billion euros of equity.” Berenberg expects Raiffeisen to sell new shares at 10 euros apiece, applying a discount to the share sale because of its size and the fact that it expects the largest shareholder, Raiffeisen Zentralbank Oesterreich AG, to be unable to participate. Retained earnings and asset sales, including of its biggest unit in Russia , won’t yield enough to plug the capital hole, Berenberg said. Bolstering capital is the biggest challenge facing Raiffeisen’s new Chief Executive Officer Karl Sevelda.

Hamburg was one of the biggest gainers, with a 10 percent increase. At least two other big German home portfolios are on the market. Bayerische Landesbank is seeking a buyer for 32,000 homes valued at about 2.4 billion euros.

Pirelli RE’s Successor Prelios, the real estate company formerly known as Pirelli RE, bought DGAG in 2007. At the time, DGAG’s apartments were valued at about 1.4 billion euros. Prelios then sold some of DGAG’s residential properties to its partnership with RREEF. In 2007, RREEF and Prelios also bought 27,000 German apartments from Cerberus Capital Management LP. The properties, known as the Baubecon portfolio, were valued at about 1.6 euros, according to a statement from Pirelli. The Baubecon and DGAG deals, both financed with about 80 percent debt, are legacies of the buyout boom in German multifamily housing before the credit crisis hit in 2008. Barclays Plc, the lender for the Baubecon purchase, took over those homes in 2011 when Prelios and RREEF refused to inject more money after building-maintenance costs and a slide in values wiped out their investment. Barclays sold Baubecon to German residential landlord Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI) in 2012.

The government sold the full offer of 10-billion dinar ($120.5 million) of 53-week Treasury bills, with yields falling by 75 basis points, or three-quarters of a percentage point, from last month, to 10.49 percent, the Debt Management Agency in the capital Belgrade, said in an e-mailed statement today. Investors’ bids amounted to 29.6 billion dinars. “We see downside yield risks amid resurgent carry trades,” analysts at Zagreb-based Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank DD, including Hrvoje Stojic , said in a note to investors before the auction. Borrowing costs have been declining amid a “lack of investment alternatives” as this year’s gross refinancing needs of around 17 percent of gross domestic product “are expected to be at least by half secured from abroad,” they said. Premier Ivica Dacic ’s seven-month-old government is paying 4.1 percentage points less on 53-week debt than in September 2012, when yields peaked at 14.59 percent. The only time Serbia paid less than 10 percent to raise dinars in the local market was between February and May 2010, according to central bank data. The budget deficit narrowed 32 percent in January from a year earlier on improved sales tax collection and a public debt decline of 0.7 percent to 17.5 billion euros ($23.5 billion), or 59.9 percent of Serbia’s economic output, the government said yesterday. Fundamentals “Stronger fundamentals” also support the Serbian dinar, which benefits from “a highly attractive carry” of some “0.9 percent per month,” Societe Generale emerging-market analysts including Benoit Anne in London, said in a note to investors today. They target the dinar at 108 to the euro in the next few months. The dinar traded at 111.6038 at 1:37 p.m. in Belgrade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Copper substitution including by aluminum, plastics and fiber optics reduced demand by 400,000 to 500,000 metric tons last year, equal to about 2 percent of global usage, according to Wood Mackenzie Ltd., an Edinburgh-based researcher. Global economies grew 3.2 percent last year compared with 3.9 percent in 2011, the International Monetary Fund estimated in January. “Copper and products for the building industry are enormously impacted by the slowdown of the economy,” Garre said in a telephone interview yesterday. “That, in my opinion, is accelerating the substitution. Especially for roofing products and plumbing tubes, we see that on top of the slowdown.” Copper usage fell 7.5 percent in Europe in the 11 months through November last year as global demand grew by about 3.5 percent, according to the International Copper Study Group in Lisbon. About 85 percent to 90 percent of KME’s sales are in Europe, according to Garre. Copper gained 4.4 percent last year on the London Metal Exchange. The metal for three-month delivery rose 0.5 percent to $7,761.25 ton by 1:01 p.m. in London, down 2.1 percent this year. Copper Output KME has 12 production locations in Europe and one in China , according to its website. Production of copper and copper alloy products this year will be unchanged at about 435,000 tons after output slumped 10 percent last year, Garre said. “To assume that in 2013 the volume will be exactly the same as in 2012, it means it’s really a negative vision,” Garre said. “It will be the first time in copper that following the crisis, the volumes stayed the same. It never happened during the last decade in copper.” KME, which has roots going back to 1886, makes products including tubes, rods, bars and sections. Demand so far this year has been comparable to the last quarter 2012, and stronger for rolled products used in automotive, electronics and electrical applications, Garre said. “It is too early to say if it will continue or not but so far this segment is the most promising compared with the other products,” Garre said. “This is probably related to the restocking effect.” KME hasn’t had problems securing copper scrap to make its products, Garre said. There is a risk of a shortage if Chinese buyers come back to the European market, he said. KME is “monitoring” changes in delivery rules at warehouses monitored by the LME, he said.')\n",

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said it will no longer give the injection, a combination of a DNA-based vaccine to prime the immune system and a booster shot with a weakened virus carrying genetic material that expressed HIV antigens. The vaccine didn’t prevent HIV infection or reduce the amount of virus in those who became infected, the agency said in a statement. The vaccine was developed by the agency’s Vaccine Research Center. Volunteers who received the active vaccination unexpectedly had higher rates of HIV than those given a placebo, though the difference wasn’t large enough to rule out a chance finding, the agency said. The researchers will follow those who participated in the trial, which started in 2009, to see if other differences develop. “While today’s result is disappointing, we need to look at the bigger picture of AIDS vaccine science,” said Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC: Global Advocacy for AIDS Prevention. “It’s not the answer we hoped for, but the search doesn’t end here.” Funding Efforts It is critical to fund efforts to develop an HIV vaccine and other methods to prevent infections in order to help end the AIDS epidemic, Warren said in a statement. A number of approaches different from that used in the current trial, known as HVTN 505, are showing promise and more data from the failed study will help refine those efforts, he said. Doctors currently prescribe potent HIV drugs such as Gilead Sciences Inc.’s Truvada to those without the disease to prevent infection. Taking the pill daily can reduce the risk of contracting HIV by 94 percent. Developing an immunization that permanently prevents infection, without lifelong, expensive pills, would be a breakthrough, researchers said. The U.S. study involved 2,504 volunteers in 19 cities across the country who received three shots over an eight-week period. After seven months, there were 27 HIV infections among those who got the vaccine and 21 infections in those given a placebo. When including everyone who participated, even those who hadn’t been in the trial for 28 weeks, there were 41 HIV infections in those given the vaccine and 30 in those given the placebo. Numerous HIV vaccine efforts, including one with a similar approach to the current trial, have failed to show a benefit. Researchers continue to hunt for an immunization that can prevent infection after the first partially successful HIV vaccine trial in Thailand in 2009.

Heller that individuals have a right to bear arms. “The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether the post- Heller individual right to keep and bear arms at home under the Second Amendment extends beyond the home,” Hamilton wrote, echoing arguments Madigan made in her request for reconsideration. ‘Bear Arms’ The U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment reads in full, “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” The December ruling was the first by a federal appeals court to invalidate legislation that restricted the carrying of firearms in public, according to today’s dissent. The majority ruling written by U.S. Circuit Judge Richard A. Posner in December “leaves the state a good deal of constitutional room for reasonable public safety measures concerning public carrying of firearms,” Hamilton said. Joining him in dissent were U.S. Circuit Judge Ann Claire Williams, who also dissented from the original ruling, along with Ilana Diamond Rovner and Diane Wood. The dissenting judges “provided a clear framework to guide the Legislature in drafting a new law,” Maura Possley, a spokeswoman for Madigan, said in an e-mailed statement. “With the 180-day deadline still in place, it is critical that the Legislature continue to work to enact a law that will protect public safety,” she said. The five judges who opposed the rehearing issued no separate opinion today. Judge Michael Kanne didn’t participate in the decision, according to a footnote in the nine-page document. The cases are Moore v. Madigan, 12-1269 and Shepard v. Madigan, 12-1788, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Chicago).')\n",

(ILMN) and Life Technologies Corp. (LIFE) to develop smaller, cheaper and quicker gene-sequencing devices, is facing technical setbacks. Oxford Nanopore, based in Oxford, England , has had to redesign components of a custom sensor because it wasn’t performing satisfactorily, which has lengthened development and testing periods, according to a post yesterday on the blog Pathogens: Genes and Genomes. The blog is found on the University of Birmingham’s website and written by Nick Loman, a doctor who works as a bioinformatics specialist at the English university. “That put us back about five months, but it was the right thing to do,” Loman quoted Oxford Nanopore Chief Technology Officer Clive Brown as saying at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology conference last month. The closely held company said more than a year ago that it expected to begin selling its products by the end of 2012. Yesterday, it didn’t deny Loman’s account of his conversation with Brown when contacted by Bloomberg News. “We should have made it clear that was off the record,” Chief Executive Officer Gordon Sanghera said of Loman’s report. “We aren’t giving any further comment on it.” The company has also had to address chemistry in its devices degrading and has been striving to reduce the error rate to 1 percent from 4 percent, according to Loman’s account of his conversation with Brown, which took place during the Feb. 20-23 AGBT meeting in Marco Island, Florida. Technical Risks IP Group Plc (IPO) owns about 20 percent of Oxford Nanopore. Competitor Illumina owns about 15 percent, and the company’s other shareholders include hedge-fund manager Lansdowne Partners LP and Invesco Perpetual, the U.K. group of mutual funds. Numis Securities’ London-based analyst Charles Weston reduced his estimate of Oxford Nanopore’s value by 25 percent to $1.5 billion from $2 billion in a Feb. 20 note to clients, citing technical-development risks. Loman wrote that Brown told him the device wouldn’t be “a year, two years late” and that the company would release data from its early-access program for its products this year. Oxford Nanopore was spun out of Oxford University in 2005 and its technology was initially based on research by Hagan Bayley, a professor of chemical biology at the university.

Individuals trying to live off bond payments are “victims” of U.S. policies to lower borrowing costs, he said.

(9501) erred by not publicly airing its suspicions that radioactive groundwater at the Fukushima nuclear plant may be leaking into the ocean, the company’s president said. The utility known as Tepco suspected that the groundwater was seeping into the Pacific more than a month before it acknowledged that the leakage was taking place on July 22, President Naomi Hirose said at a press conference today. That acknowledgment was based on data shared with him three days earlier, said Hirose, who apologized for that delay as well. “There are many points I regret,” Hirose said. “Our announcement was delayed because we decided to wait until more reliable data became available instead of informing of risks in a proactive way.” Hirose vowed that the company would be faster to share information with the public in the future. Tepco first suspected that the water was leaking into the ocean on June 19, when it found strontium and tritium in a monitoring well at a turbine complex within the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, which was damaged in the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, Hirose said. The company’s failure to acknowledge its concerns over the seepage into the ocean continued on July 10, when the Nuclear Regulation Authority said it suspected there was a leak and urged the utility to speed construction of a seawall to block contaminated water. Reform Committee Hirose and Tepco Vice President Zengo Aizawa each had one month of their salaries cut by 10 percent as a penalty for delaying disclosure of the leak, according to a company statement today. Hirose acknowledged the delay during a briefing that had been meant to focus on discussions held earlier in the day by Tepco’s Nuclear Reform Monitoring Committee , a panel of outside experts set up after the accident to help guide the resumption of the company’s nuclear plants. “It is very frustrating for the members of the committee to arrive just in time when there is groundwater leakage and a very poor communication program, said Committee Chairman Dale Klein , a former chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ‘‘From what we’ve seen, it’s more of what I’d call incompetence instead of any cover-up.”')\n",

The prevalence of these health concerns increased as the survivors aged, and two-thirds of those treated for childhood cancer reported a severe, disabling or life-threatening condition as adults, according to a study released today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. As new therapies allow patients to live longer after a cancer diagnosis, researchers are beginning to focus on the gap between successful treatment by oncologists and follow-up by other doctors. Chemotherapy and radiation, the weapons used to attack cancer, can carry severe side effects, some of which emerge years after treatment, the authors wrote. Today’s data, the first to measure clinical outcomes from older survivors, is striking for the number of those with declining mental ability, heart valve disorders and lowered lung function. “It’s surprising that so many had new health abnormalities discovered by the testing,” Melissa Hudson , an oncologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis , said in a telephone interview. “Our survivors have grown up and gone out in the community with primary care physicians who may not be aware of their risks, since pediatric cancer survivors are relatively rare.” Initial Screening The results underscore the importance of making sure cancer survivors and their doctors have information about the initial treatment. That will lead to better screening, Hudson said. Many of the ailments detected in the cancer survivors were in “mild-to-moderate stages,” she said, allowing the opportunity to preserve the health of the patients, she said. The study, of more than 1,700 adult survivors of childhood cancer, found that 98 percent experienced a chronic health ailment.

Flight capacity is squeezed at London’s airports, with Gatwick and Heathrow close to full, while Mayor Boris Johnson has pledged to block any expansion in favor of a new hub in the River Thames estuary. The state-appointed Airport Commission is considering 58 proposals, ranging from runway extensions to developing green-field sites and aims to release an interim report in December, with a final report in 2015, Davies said. Heathrow Airport Ltd., the hub’s owner, submitted three plans to the commission, each capable of delivering extra flights by 2025-29 at a cost of 14 billion pounds ($22.5 billion) to 18 billion pounds.

Portugal and Ireland are counting on a decision by European finance (IRF) ministers this week to lengthen the repayment times, smoothing the way out of the debt crisis for both countries. Portugal’s case is less clear cut after last week’s supreme court ruling blocked 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in savings, forcing Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho to find new reductions to appease creditors. Coelho has ordered spending cuts and ruled out tax increases to close the gap. The European Commission has championed a lengthening of the loan maturities, with Economic and Monetary Commissioner Olli Rehn telling reporters in Brussels today that such a concession would be “a core part of our exercise to support the exit of the two countries from the programs.” Creditor governments led by the Netherlands and Germany want to proceed more slowly, unwilling to grant leniency while Portugal’s budget policy is in flux. Creditors are also wary of making concessions without backing from their own parliaments. As a result, the maturity extensions, in the works for several months, might only get a conditional endorsement from an April 12 meeting in Dublin, a European official told reporters in Brussels today on condition of anonymity. ‘Next Month’ A failure to decide in Dublin would mean that “it will be done next month,” Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the euro meetings, said today in The Hague. A seven-year extension is the most likely of five options in a paper for the Dublin session that was prepared by the “troika” of the commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund , along with the European Financial Stability Facility. “Given the current volatility in the markets, quick implementation is recommended to maximize benefits in shielding Ireland and Portugal from possible contagion effects,”   said the paper, which was distributed to German lawmakers and seen by Bloomberg News. Ireland aims to exit its bailout at the end of this year, while Portugal’s program ends in May 2014.

While demand and output are expanding, the labour market remains weak. Economic growth and inflation are being shaped by a range of forces. The Canterbury rebuild is gaining momentum and residential investment and business and consumer confidence are increasing. House price inflation is increasing and the Bank does not want to see financial stability or inflation risks accentuated by housing demand getting too far ahead of supply. “The overvalued New Zealand dollar is undermining profitability in export and import competing industries, and worsening drought conditions are creating difficulty in much of the country. Ongoing fiscal consolidation will also act to slow overall demand. “We project the economy to grow at an annual rate of between 2 and 3 percent over the forecast period.

Speaking at the Chatham House international affairs center, the former prime minster told lawmakers that they shouldn’t think “offering advice” to Cameron would lead other countries to “hear the strength of feeling and immediately capitulate.” Such behavior means Cameron “would be seen to be acting under duress,” Major said. “I’ve been there.” Major said Cameron should appoint a personal negotiator to the EU, and give them a seat in Cabinet. If the prime minister’s Liberal Democrat coalition partners were to object, Major said, “the prime minister should overrule them. The tail must not wag the dog.” His advice on negotiations was to hold them “courteously and with understanding. If we enter them with the aggressive attitude of ‘give us our way or we will quit,’ we will fail.” In a Feb. 11 Parliamentary session, some Conservatives argued that Cameron’s success this month in negotiating a cut in the EU budget showed that threatening to leave had worked.

Kuwait is the only member of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, which also includes Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman, that doesn’t peg its currency to the U.S. dollar. Qatar hasn’t altered its benchmark interest rate since August 2011, when it cut the overnight lending rate 50 basis points to 4.5 percent, the second reduction in a year. The Qatari currency traded at an average of 3.641 riyals to the dollar over the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Qatar, the world’s biggest producer of liquefied natural gas, plans to invest $200 billion in infrastructure projects such as roads, stadiums, hotels and a rail network, before hosting the soccer World Cup in 2022. Inflation in the country accelerated to an annual 3.7 percent in April, the fastest rate since at least February 2010, when Bloomberg started keeping records.')\n",

With the world economy still subdued, further repair of banks’ balance sheets is necessary, which may require more capital for some lenders and closure for others, David Lipton , the fund’s first deputy managing director, said in a speech in Washington yesterday. He also called for unwinding of excessive public and private debt. “If these medium-term challenges are not adequately addressed, the recent rally in global markets may prove unsustainable,” Lipton said, according to his prepared remarks. “And the still fragile confidence in banks and the wider financial system could turn into fear, which could trigger a renewed sense of crisis.” The MSCI World Index (MXWO) of stocks has risen about 7 percent this year as equity markets in the U.S., Japan and Europe rallied. Still, the Washington-based IMF earlier this year cut its global growth forecast for 2013. Recently it said it would lower its prediction for the U.S., where $85 billion in federal government spending cuts have started to take effect. Speaking to members of the Chartered Financial Analyst Society of Washington , Lipton said the global financial system is not yet safe, even if it is in a better shape than five years ago. ‘Enough Holes’ “Think of it as a huge safety net that has been mended and strengthened, but still has enough holes that we cannot yet feel protected,” he said. He criticized “delays and dilutions” in a reform agenda agreed upon by the Group of 20 economies, calling “a particular worry” the delay in implementation of Basel III international capital standards in the European Union and the U.S. Lipton said less progress has been made in the derivatives market. “National authorities have not met recent deadlines to implement these reforms, reflecting the legal complexities of this opaque industry,” he said. Another area Lipton called “particularly troubling to many global stakeholders” is a lack of movement to a single set of financial reporting standards that the G-20 called for. He cited diverging views of the International Accounting Standards Board and Financial Accounting Standards Board on the “credit loss recognition models based on expected rather than incurred losses is a major setback to the convergence process. ‘‘That will leave European and U.S. banks estimating loan loss provisions with different methodologies,’’ he said.')\n",

The value of RINs, which are used by refiners and the Environmental Protection Agency to determine compliance with government biofuel mandates, reached a record $1.06 on March 8 for the corn-based variety, compared with 7.1 cents Jan. 7, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Biofuel proponents and oil industry interests differ over the impact of the higher RINs values and their effect on gasoline prices. The American Petroleum Institute says that a U.S. law requiring increasing amounts of ethanol in a shrinking gasoline pool is behind the rise and that the mandate should be repealed. “A fact-based review of developments in the gasoline, ethanol and Renewable Identification Number markets indicates that the Renewable Fuels Standard in general and RINs in particular have not been a demonstrable factor in the rise in retail gasoline prices that has occurred in early 2013,” Informa said in the report, commissioned by the ethanol lobby. RINs for conventional grain-based ethanol rose 9.9 percent to 66.5 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane- based ethanol, climbed 2.7 percent to 75 cents. Federal Mandate A 2007 energy law requires the U.S. to use 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol this year and 14.4 billion next year. Each gallon of ethanol produced is assigned a RIN, and once refiners blend the biofuel with gasoline they can either retain the certificate to show compliance or they can trade it. The effect of RINs on gasoline retail prices is 0.0004 cent a gallon and when adjusted to reflect ethanol’s discount to gasoline, consumers are receiving just under a 0.04 cent per gallon benefit at the pump, Scott Richman, senior vice president at Informa, based in Memphis , Tennessee , said today on a conference call with reporters. U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and chair of the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee, sent a letter to the EPA on March 22 asking for data to explain the recent volatility in the RIN market. “We would absolutely support more visibility and more transparency into this market,” Geoff Cooper, vice president of research and analysis at the Renewable Fuels Association, a Washington-based trade group, said on the call.')\n",

(005930) , fighting a global battle with Apple Inc. (AAPL) over disputed patents, lost a court bid in Australia to bring up evidence showing the two sides have been involved in on-going settlement talks. Samsung sought, through witness statements, to show there have been ongoing talks “until recently” to determine a fair royalty, according to a Nov. 4 ruling. The decision issued by Australia Federal Court Justice Annabelle Bennett was posted on the court’s website today with redactions to commercially sensitive references, including the specifics of the royalties. Bennett dismissed the request, saying it was made too late and would disrupt the timetable for a trial. Apple had unsuccessfully sued Samsung in Australia in 2011 seeking a ban on the sale of its Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablets, claiming the South Korean company infringed its touch-screen patents. Samsung countersued claiming Apple devices infringed three of its standard-essential patents. Apple countered with a suit accusing Samsung of breaching international obligations to negotiate a fair royalty on the patents. “Substantial costs would be wasted and it is more probable than not that the hearing date would need to be vacated,” Bennett wrote. “Samsung has been given more than sufficient opportunity to agitate its case.” A trial on Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung’s counterclaim is scheduled to begin Nov. 26 and run through April 10 in federal court in Sydney. Battle Royalties Apple’s cross-claim is based on an offer made by Samsung on July 25, 2011 for a specific royalty to be paid for each product, details of which are crossed out in Bennett’s judgment. Apple, based in Cupertino, California , claims it’s willing to pay a royalty on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, known as FRAND, as required by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. Samsung has refused and continues to refuse to offer FRAND royalty terms, Apple said, a claim Samsung has denied. The Australian dispute coincides with Apple’s bid to recoup most of the $410.5 million that U.S, District Judge Lucy Koh cut from the original $1.05 billion a jury in San Jose , California, awarded Apple for Samsung’s patent infringement. The do-over trial began yesterday in San Jose. Litigation between the two companies began in the U.S. in April 2011, when Apple sued Samsung for “slavishly copying” its iPhone and iPad designs. It has since spread to France , Germany , Italy , U.K., South Korea, Japan and the Netherlands. The Australian case is Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. NSD315/2013.

The losses “may be higher than initially anticipated” and demonstrate “a risk of management weaknesses,” S&P said in a statement late yesterday. The Siena-based lender had its long- term grade cut to BB from BB+ and remains on watch negative, which means the company may be downgraded again. Shares fell as much as 2.9 percent in Milan trading today. Monte Paschi said last month it may be forced to restate results after Bloomberg News reported that it used derivatives to obscure losses. Accounting irregularities led to the criminal investigation targeting previous management. The bank is seeking state help to bolster its balance sheet after failing to meet capital requirements set by the European Banking Authority. The Italian lender is also selling assets and reducing risk and costs to restore liquidity. Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Viola said Jan. 28 the board will complete the bank’s bailout request by early February and the Italian Treasury will conclude the transaction by the end of that month. S&P said the likelihood that the Italian government will give financial support to Monte Paschi if needed is “moderately high” because the bank holds “high systemic importance” to the country’s banking sector, according to the statement. Bonds Fall Monte Paschi fell 1.8 percent to 24.22 cents as of 10:05 a.m., valuing the bank at 2.8 billion euros ($3.8 billion). Monte Paschi’s 4.875 percent bonds due 2014 dropped 0.14 cents on the euro to 98.38 euro cents at 8:58 a.m. in London , the fifth straight day of declines, Bloomberg Bond Trader prices show. That’s pushed the yield up to 516 basis points more than the benchmark midswap rate, the highest since the bonds were sold in September. Moody’s Investors Service also placed Monte Paschi debt on review for a downgrade on Jan. 30 because of “considerable uncertainty” over the impact of the structured finance deals. Documents revealed last month show that Monte Paschi’s former management used structured-finance deals to hide losses from previous operations.

(8303) , the Japanese bank partly owned by J. Christopher Flowers , set up a fund that bought a nursing home for 1.7 billion yen ($19 million), as it plans to list a health-care real estate investment trust. The bank has raised about 500 million yen from individual investors and financed the rest of the purchase through loans, said Takashi Fujimura, the general manager of Shinsei’s health- care finance division. It plans to set up separate funds to acquire at least one property each quarter as it prepares for its 100 billion yen REIT listing in 2014, he said. The so-called bridge fund will become a part of Shinsei’s health-care REIT that will invest in nursing homes and properties for retirees in Japan , which has one of the world’s fastest-aging populations. One in every four people in Japan will be older than 65 in 2014, compared with 9.6 percent in China and 14 percent in the U.S., according to data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. “The interest generated from individual investors confirmed our belief that the REIT will do well,” Fujimura said in an interview in Tokyo yesterday. “Because the rental income generated from retiree homes is steady, it provides a very stable return for investors.” The government set up a committee in September to discuss how to allow the listing of health-care REITs in an effort to increase the supply of such facilities. Shinsei is a member of the panel representing the financial sector, according to the land ministry. Nursing Shortage The fund, which costs 2.5 million yen per unit for individuals to invest, offers a 3.5 percent annual return, Fujimura said. Shinsei plans to target nursing homes with a value of at least 2 billion yen, he said. About a quarter of 421,000 applicants had to wait for the availability of a bed in public nursing homes in 2009, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The number of people using elderly care facilities is estimated to increase by 25 percent to 1.15 million in 2015 from 920,000 in 2011, according to data from the Cabinet Office. Japan has about 4,000 operators of housing projects for the elderly, Fujimura said. Shinsei will focus on the top operators and examine their credit as well as the quality and past performance of each property, he said. Shinsei also plans to invest in a company that operates a health-care REIT as a way to enter the market and provide lending to the trust, Fujimura said. “This is a very young industry,” said Fujimura. “There are many small operators.

Fuji Heavy gained 2.1 percent to 1,898 yen in Tokyo trading, the highest close since at least 1974. Net income will probably decline 8 percent to 110 billion yen in the year started April 1, while sales will rise 7.2 percent to 2.05 trillion yen, according to the statement.

He was 60. He died yesterday of a heart attack, according to the NFL’s website , citing the San Diego Chargers , his final team in the league. No further details were provided. Muncie was the third overall pick of the New Orleans Saints in the 1976 NFL draft out of the University of California , where he finished second to Archie Griffin in voting for the 1975 Heisman Trophy. At 6-foot-3 and 227 pounds, Muncie teamed with fellow rookie Tony Galbreath as part of a Saints backfield known as “Thunder and Lightning.” Muncie spent his first 4 1/2 NFL seasons in New Orleans and was voted the Most Valuable Player at the 1979 Pro Bowl before joining the Chargers for 4 1/2 years. In 1981, Muncie rushed for 1,114 yards and set a then-NFL record with 19 rushing touchdowns. For his career, Muncie rushed for 6,702 yards and 71 touchdowns while averaging 4.3 yards a carry. He was suspended by the NFL for the 1984 season after testing positive for cocaine and marijuana use and wouldn’t play in the league again even though he attempted a comeback in 1985. In 1989, Muncie was in a federal prison, serving an 18-month sentence on cocaine distribution charges. After Jail “I had too much time on my hands and went to a lot of parties,” Muncie was quoted as saying in a 1999 story in Cal-Berkeley’s alumni magazine. “Because I was famous, everyone gave me cocaine so I would hang out with them.” Muncie had said going to jail probably saved his life. Following his release, Muncie became active in youth programs and community service, and later founded the Chuck Muncie Youth Foundation to mentor at-risk youth in Southern California. In addition to helping youth change their lives in a positive way, according to the foundation website, it also reaches tens of thousands of kids with free medical services, childhood immunizations, tattoo removal screenings and camps for chronically ill children. “I had everything, and I ruined it all because of drugs,” Muncie was quoted as saying in a 1995 Los Angeles Times story ahead of the Chargers’ Super Bowl appearance. “I’m angry at myself. I see guys I played with doing things I could have done. But when I feel that way I look at this club and these kids and remember there is a reason for everything.

Of 17 species of butterfly monitored over the 22-year period, eight declined, two remained stable and one increased, while for six species the trend is uncertain, the European Union’s environmental agency wrote in an online report. Europe’s butterfly population is monitored through field counts of species such as the wall brown, common blue and orangetip in countries including France and Germany , the EU’s biggest agricultural producers. Butterflies are considered useful indicators of biodiversity and representative for developments for other insects, the EEA wrote. “This dramatic decline in grassland butterflies should ring alarm bells,” Hans Bruyninckx, the EEA’s executive director, was cited as saying. “If we fail to maintain these habitats we could lose many of these species forever.” The main reason for the falling butterfly populations is changing rural land use, with intensification of farming where land is relatively flat and easy to cultivate, while large areas of grassland have been abandoned in mountains and wet areas, mainly in eastern and southern Europe, according to the agency. Butterflies are also vulnerable to pesticides, it said. Of Europe’s 436 butterfly species, grasslands are home to 382 and the main habitat for 280, according to the report. The falling butterfly count indicates a “dramatic loss” of grassland biodiversity, according to the EEA.

Related Cos., the New York developer founded by billionaire Stephen Ross, and its partner Gulf Capital plan to build a $1 billion shopping mall focusing on department stores in Abu Dhabi. Gulf Related, the joint venture undertaking the project, is also aiming construct two towers connected to the mall that will include a 300-room hotel as well as 120 serviced apartments, Kenneth Himmel, president and chief executive officer of Related Urban, told reporters in Abu Dhabi today. Related Urban is a unit of Related Cos. Sowwah Central, as the project is named, is the venture’s second development on Sowwah island, which will be the location for a financial district and Abu Dhabi’s stock exchange. The mall, due to be completed in 2017, will be financed by a combination of equity and debt, Himmel said. Gulf Related bought the land last year from Abu Dhabi’s sovereign investment fund Mubadala Development Co. PJSC, which hasn’t yet decided whether it will invest in this project, Himmel said. Gulf Related may assume debt to fund as much as 60 percent of the development, designed to include cinemas, health clubs and restaurants, Himmel said. He declined to specify the amount of equity Gulf Related plans to invest in the project or the price of the land. Wealth Funds “Gulf Capital and Related are anchoring this project,” said Karim El Solh, Chief Executive Officer of United Arab Emirates’ private equity firm Gulf Capital. “We are approaching investors such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, financial institutions and family owned companies who are looking for a long-term cash yield.” The response has been positive, helped by the company’s ability to get commitments for seven- to 10-year leases from retailers it’s in discussions with, El Solh said. Investors should expect an annual yield of 12 percent to 13 percent once the mall is fully occupied, he said. Gulf Related is also looking at funding through bonds and will announce the details of the financing in about three months, Himmel said. The company is in talks to bring two department stores to the mall, with each to occupy 20,000 square meters, he said. He declined to name the potential tenants. Sowwah Central will have a gross area of 288,000 square meters (3.1 million square feet). “We don’t want to over leverage, so we are looking for debt of 50 percent to 60 percent,” Himmel said. Debt will mostly be raised locally and regionally, he said, without identifying the banks.

Berlusconi blamed Prime Minister Mario Monti and politicians he said had communist sympathies in the two-and-a- half hour interview. The host, Michele Santoro, periodically interrupted to show reports highlighting Italians’ economic desperation and a video of the ex-premier making a gaffe when meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Berlusconi, who resigned in November 2011, was asked at the start of the discussion to apologize for Italy ’s crisis. “I will not admit any responsibility,” Berlusconi said. The appearance on TV station La 7 was part of a media blitz the 76-year-old billionaire is seeking to use to regain public support ahead of elections at the end of February. Santoro and a team of journalists, with questions and a series of monologues, accused Berlusconi of mishandling the economy, collaborating with the Mafia and paying for sex. The media mogul, dressed in a blue double-breasted suit, rejected the charges. Berlusconi blamed his legal troubles, which include a tax fraud conviction and a pending trial on charges of engaging a minor in prostitution, on politically motivated judges and prosecutors. He said left-leaning politicians with communist mindsets are responsible for Italy’s economic woes and that he never paid for sex. “The envy of the left is in the communist ideology, and that is the most inhuman and criminal ideology in the history of man,” Berlusconi said. Belly-to-Belly The two sides drew applause and laughter from the studio audience, reaching a crescendo more than two hours into the show when Santoro interrupted Berlusconi and the two men began shouting at each other. Berlusconi stood up with a smile to shake hands, and when Santoro refused the gesture, the ex- premier drew belly-to-belly with the journalist and gave him a shove in the arm. Berlusconi said he considered himself “a good and righteous man.” “Anyway the impression we have of ourselves isn’t important,” Santoro said. There has been bad blood between Berlusconi and Santoro since at least 2002, when the journalist was ousted from state broadcaster RAI by the then-premier. Santoro’s show was canceled after Berlusconi accused him and two other presenters of making criminal use of state television. He did not broadcast again for four years and was elected with a center-left party to the European Parliament. In the 1990s, Santoro worked for Berlusconi at the billionaire’s Milan-based Mediaset SpA. (MS) ')\n",

Renamo denied responsibility for the attack. “Mozambique’s government is concentrating troops to attack” Gorongosa, an area where Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama is based, Jeronimo Malagueta, a spokesman for the party, told reporters in the capital, Maputo, today. “Renamo’s militiamen will take positions to defend Gorongosa.” Renamo, formerly backed by South Africa’s apartheid government, fought a 15-year civil war against the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique , or Frelimo, that ended in 1992 with a peace agreement brokered by church groups. The party last year said it could resume the conflict and complained that elections in 2009, won by Frelimo, were unfair. Three people were killed in an attack on a bus in the central district of Muxungue on April 6, while four members of Mozambique’s special police force and a militiaman loyal to Renamo died in clashes in the same area on April 4, according to the government.

The measure, down 0.8 basis point in February, is heading for its fourth straight monthly decline. Senators turned back a Democratic proposal to stall the spending cuts and no additional congressional action is planned before they start. The across-the-board reductions will total $1.2 trillion over nine years, with $85 billion set to take effect in the remaining seven months of this fiscal year. “The Senate news gave investors a reason to sell and dashed some hopes for a last minute deal,” Anthony Valeri, a market strategist at San Diego-based LPL Financial , said in an e-mail. The news is “driving some late apprehension,” he said. The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.

(AAPL) as much as $14 billion in purchase commitments over time if the mobile carrier fails to sell an agreed number of iPhones, a report from Moffett Research LLC said. Under a multiyear deal signed with Apple in 2010, Verizon Wireless is obligated to buy $23.5 billion worth of iPhones in 2013 alone, according to Craig Moffett, a telecommunications analyst who left Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. earlier this year to start his own research firm. Since the purchase commitment is more than twice what Verizon Wireless sold in 2012, the company may have a shortfall of $12 billion to $14 billion, worth $4 to $5 per share, Moffett said in the report. The report suggests sluggish demand for the iPhone, which accounts for about half of Apple’s sales. Other wireless providers around the world may be experiencing iPhone sales deficits as well, Moffett said. The sales shortfall bolsters analysts’ projection for Apple to report a 22 percent decline in net income to $6.87 billion in the third fiscal quarter, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. “It is likely that Apple would be reluctant to simply ignore these commitments, since many other carriers around the world are probably in a similar situation, and a simple amnesty would set an unwanted precedent,” Moffett wrote. “It is therefore unrealistic to think that Apple won’t extract some consideration for renegotiating these shortfalls.” Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Apple, and Brenda Raney , a spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, declined to comment on Verizon’s iPhone purchase commitments. Sprint Commitments Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , which began selling iPhones in 2011, will probably be able to meet its commitment to buy $15.5 billion worth of iPhones over four years “barring any hiccup in Sprint’s rate of handset sales or the popularity of the iPhone,” Moffett said. Scott Sloat , a spokesman for Sprint, didn’t have an immediate response. Verizon and Sprint’s contractual obligations with Apple may be the reason why some carriers are holding out on partnering with the Cupertino, California-based company, Moffett said. Apple has announced fewer than a dozen new wireless-service providers to sell iPhones since September 2011, leaving the total at about 240. Many carriers balk at working with Apple because of the conditions it imposes. Holdouts include China Mobile Ltd.

The government granted Epangelo exclusive exploration rights in 2011 as the company builds its presence in the mining industry. Hawala said Epangelo would consider ceding majority stakes to its partners should they be prepared to finance the projects and bring them to commercial production. “If an investor meets certain milestones, we will also be reducing our shareholding to agreed levels,” Hawala said. Epangelo is jointly exploring for zinc and other base metals with Vedanta Resources Plc’s Skorpion mine and refinery and for nuclear fuels at the Lofdal license area of Toronto-listed Namibia Rare Earths Inc.

The value of municipal permits rose 10.5 percent to C$6.96 billion ($6.73 billion), following a revised 6 percent rise in March, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The gain was the fourth in a row, the longest streak of increases in a decade. Economists forecast a 3 percent decline in April, according to the median of 11 responses to a Bloomberg survey. Surging home construction has helped drive household debts to a record 165 percent of disposable income, a ratio the central bank says should stabilize as housing investment wanes. Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Timothy Lane said June 4 in Seoul there are signs of a “constructive evolution” in household finances after “imbalances” built up. Residential permits rose 21 percent to C$4.35 billion in April, Statistics Canada said today. Permits for housing projects such as apartments and condominiums jumped 51.9 percent to C$2.15 billion, and single-family permits rose 1.1 percent to C$2.21 billion. Vancouver made one of the largest contributions to the national increase among 34 cities, Statistics Canada said, with permits rising 50.7 percent to C$645 million led by multi-family dwellings. Calgary permits also rose 40.6 percent to C$773 million on commercial buildings. Condo Overbuilding Finance Minister Jim Flaherty tightened mortgage rules for a fourth time last year on concern that there has been an overbuilding of condos in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver.

The value of permits was 5.4 percent higher in April than the same month a year earlier, with multiple-unit housing 40.4 percent higher on the year.

       "Sprint Corp. (S) raised $6.5 billion yesterday in the biggest high-yield offering since 2008 as sales of speculative-grade securities surpass last year’s record pace. Sprint’s $4.25 billion of 7.875 percent, 10-year notes priced to yield 498 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and its $2.25 billion of 7.25 percent, eight-year debt pays a spread of 466 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Proceeds from the issue by the third-largest U.S wireless carrier will be used for general corporate purposes, Bloomberg data show. The securities are rated B1 by Moody’s Investors Service, four levels below investment grade, and one step higher at BB- at Standard & Poor’s. Sales of dollar-denominated junk-rated debt this year of $242.5 billion exceed the $202.9 billion sold in the corresponding period of 2012, Bloomberg data show. Borrowers issued a record $357.3 billion of high-yield debt last year. The sale is the largest high-yield offering since June 2008, when Intelsat priced $7.1 billion of bonds through three units, Bloomberg data show. Yields on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index have declined to 6.86 percent as of yesterday from a record high 22.65 percent during the credit crisis in December 2008 and reached an unprecedented low of 5.98 percent on May 9. Offering Increased The size of Sprint’s sale was earlier set at a minimum of $4 billion, a person familiar with the transaction said yesterday. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest underwriter of junk debt, led the offering. Sprint was bought by SoftBank Corp. in July for $21.6 billion in founder Masayoshi Son’s bid to make the Overland Park, Kansas-based company a stronger rival against Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc., owners of the two biggest U.S. wireless carriers. Tokyo-based SoftBank’s takeover included a $5 billion cash infusion, giving Sprint money to bolster its network and pursue acquisitions. Verizon is planning to sell as much as $50 billion of investment-grade bonds to fund its purchase of Vodafone Group Plc’s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless, a person briefed on the company’s plans said Sept. 2."

(AAPL) ’s iPhones, predicts a shift in demand toward lower-priced smartphones will help boost royalty revenue. “There is a shift advantage for ARM as mid-range and entry smartphones drive smartphone growth. We’ve got that dynamic going into next year,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said at a conference in Barcelona yesterday. “Those phones generate much more royalty for ARM because they use more silicon.” ARM has had five consecutive years of revenue growth as its designs for chips that control graphics and processing were used in increasingly popular smartphones and tablets. Royalty payments took the spotlight last quarter as they missed analysts’ estimates. ARM shares have fallen almost 9 percent since the earnings report on Oct. 22. “As ARM technology becomes more sophisticated, the royalty percentage goes up,” Score said. “On average, it’s going to very gradually go up.” Global smartphone shipments surged 40 percent last quarter, slowing from 53 percent growth for the previous three-month period, according to researcher IDC. The average selling prices of the devices fell by 13 percent to $317 from a year earlier, because of demand for more affordable handsets. In spite of concerns about slowing growth, especially in China, Score said ARM can continue expanding its customer base and outperforming the semiconductor market in the next five years, driven by cheaper handsets, enterprise networking and micro-controllers. ARM shares fell less than 1 percent to 953.50 pence at 9:16 a.m. in London. New Chief Chief Executive Officer Simon Segars, who succeeded Warren East in July, is confronting a shift in the industry’s growth to low-end smartphones and new entrant Intel Corp. (INTC) , which has begun designing its own chips for mobile phones. ARM, based in Cambridge, England, is also seeking to boost its market share in servers as companies from Facebook Inc. (FB) to Google Inc. (GOOG) look for lower-power machines to drive their data centers. It’s “possible to identify such a market and build a chip specifically for that market, whether it is to handle only storage or only video loading, for example. We can make the chip much more efficient,” Score said at the annual Technology, Media and Telecoms Conference organized by Morgan Stanley. “Everyone knows Intel has a very strong ecosystem around servers, we’re not kidding ourselves,” Score said. “For that reason we see it as further out.”'),\n",

As a private company, Western Digital wouldn’t have to respond to public shareholder demands and could increase its cash flow, Miller said. “Its cash flows could be $4 billion to $5 billion a year in a few years,” Miller said.

There is a strong desire to do it, but I am not convinced we are going back to seeing mega LBOs.” Separately, an unexpected increase in interest rates could pose another threat to mergers, he said. Central banks have pumped some $9.3 trillion of credit into the market place. When rates increased in 1994, fixed income investors suffered. This is because when interest rates increase, bond prices decline. “How do you clean up this liquidity without massive disruption in the bond markets?” he said.'),\n",

(GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) about selling shares in a public offering as early as this year. The company, which has its headquarters in Orlando , Florida , as well as in London , plans to select bankers this year after introducing a service that will provide easier access to its app platforms, Chief Executive Officer Raj Koneru said in an interview yesterday. The share sale will take place this year or in 2014, he said. “We are talking with a lot of bankers,” Koneru said. The company hasn’t decided how much stock to sell or the amount of funds to raise, he said. Kony, which has yet to make a profit, expects to record $80 million to $100 million in revenue this year, about double its 2012 sales, Koneru said. An initial public offering could raise at least $120 million for Kony, valuing the company at more than $700 million, Tom Taulli , an analyst who covers IPOs, said in an interview. “Enterprise is really hot right now,” Taulli said. “Right place at the right time -- that always helps with an IPO. I suspect they’ll do well.” Spending on app-development tools for multiple mobile operating systems will grow at an average annual rate of 39 percent to reach $8.2 billion in 2016, according to Smith’s Point Analytics LLC. Founded in 2007, Kony sells annual subscriptions for its app platform-service, which allows developers to customize products to their own specifications. The company has raised about $35 million from Georgian Partners and Insight Venture Partners and may use proceeds from an IPO to improve its software and for research and development, Koneru said.')]"

       "\n",
       "William Frels and Mark Henneman, who run the $2.5 billion Mairs & Power Growth Fund (MPGFX) , were named domestic stock-fund managers of the year by Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  The top honor for international stock funds went to the $1.3 billion Virtus Foreign Opportunities Fund and the $6.8 billion Virtus Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund, both run by Rajiv Jain, Chicago-based Morningstar said in a statement today. The fixed-income winner was Mark Kiesel , manager of the $10.2 billion Pimco Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund. The six-member team that runs the $1.8 billion TFS Market Neutral Fund (TFSMX) won in the alternatives category. David Giroux of the $13.7 billion T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund was named allocation fund manager of the year. Both are new categories for the research firm’s awards. The Mairs & Power Growth Fund returned an average of 5.6 percent annually over the past five years, better than 89 percent of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last year it returned 22 percent, topping 95 percent of rivals. Of the fund’s largest 25 holdings , 18 were bought in the 1990s and 17 have been in the portfolio for at least 10 years, Morningstar said in the statement. Virtus Emerging Markets Opportunities Fund (HIEMX) gained 3.8 percent annually for the past five years, better than 94 percent of competitors. The fund returned 20 percent in 2012, besting 58 percent of peers, according to the data. Kiesel’s Pimco fund outperformed 91 percent of similar funds over the past five years, returning 10 percent annually. The fund, which topped 77 percent of rivals in 2012, had 17 percent of its money in bank debt as of Sept. 30. Market Neutral TFS Market Neutral Fund gained 4.5 percent annually for the past five years, better than 97 percent of peers. The team’s 7.8 return last year topped 84 percent of rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morningstar defines alternative investments as those that don’t fit neatly into traditional stock or fixed-income categories. T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation gained 6 percent a year for the past five years, ahead of 95 percent of rivals. Its largest holding was Waltham, Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) as of Sept. 30, the data show. Giroux’s 15 percent return in 2012 beat 82 percent of the competition.\n",

       "\n",
       "Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s largest maker of mobile phones, said it was boosting venture- capital funding by $100 million to help create new businesses for its unit making memory chips and electronics parts. The company unveiled the Catalyst Fund for early stage startups, as well as a strategy and innovation center in Menlo Park , California , at an event near the site on Sand Hill Road. The company and affiliates also run the $1 billion Samsung Ventures America Fund. “We must reach out to global hot spots and global talent,” Young Sohn, president and chief strategy officer of device solutions for Samsung, said at the event. “This is the epicenter of disruptive forces.” Like other companies such as Intel Corp. (INTC) , Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp., Samsung is trying to use its cash to encourage the development of technology that will benefit its business in the future. Traditional venture-capital investors aren’t investing in basic science and technology startups, creating a gap that Samsung intends to help fill, Sohn said. Samsung’s venture arm, now headquartered in Seoul, has more than $1 billion in assets under management and did 20 deals worth $160 million last year, Sohn said. Investments by the new funds will be in the areas of Internet-connected devices, mobile health, computer-human interface, cloud-data centers and mobile privacy, he said. Shares of the Suwon, South Korea-based company fell 0.1 percent to 1,435,000 won in South Korean trading today.\n",

       "Fewer U.S. Shares Available Fuels Bull Market: Chart of the Day\n",
       "\n",
       "Repurchases are magnifying gains in U.S. stocks and are poised to lift prices further, according to Pavilion Global Markets Ltd. strategists. As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index has risen more than the market value of all U.S. companies since the current bull market started in March 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Through last week, the gap was about 13 percentage points. “The difference comes from a reduction in the number of shares,” Pierre Lapointe , head of global strategy and research at the Montreal-based firm, and two colleagues wrote yesterday in a report. “The resulting de-equitization is giving a boost to this stock-market rally.” S&P 500 calculations are based on 2.3 percent fewer shares than in July 2011, when the total reached its high for the bull market, the strategists estimated. A drop in stock outstanding accounted for 25 percent of the past year’s earnings-per-share growth for companies in the index, they added. Apple Inc., the world’s largest company by market value, increased its stock-buyback program last month by $50 billion. That’s enough to pay for about 12 percent of the Cupertino, California-based company’s shares at their closing price yesterday. The program will run through 2015. “De-equitization is a global phenomenon,” Lapointe and his colleagues added. In most developed markets, FTSE stock indexes rose faster than total market value during the past year, according to their report. This was also the case in Brazil, Mexico and South Korea , three emerging markets.\n",

       "\n",
       "Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) , the third- biggest independent U.S. custody bank, said first-quarter profit rose 1.7 percent as stock-market gains boosted the value of assets the company oversees. Net income increased to $164 million, or 67 cents per diluted share, from $161.2 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier, the Chicago-based company said today in a statement. Results missed the 72-cent average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. “We have a better macro backdrop with higher market levels this quarter, and we saw good organic growth across all three” of the largest publicly listed custody banks, Brian Bedell, a New York-based analyst at ISI Group Inc., said in an interview before results were released. The custody banks, under pressure to improve profitability hurt by record-low interest rates, are benefiting as global equity markets climb for the second straight year. Northern Trust, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederick H. Waddell, followed larger rivals Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) and State Street Corp. (STT) with job cuts in 2012 that, combined with technology initiatives, are designed to increase annual pretax income by $250 million by the end of this year. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) of U.S. stocks returned 14 percent in the 12 months ended March 31, and global stocks, as measured by the MSCI ACWI Index, advanced 11 percent, with reinvested dividends. Rate Impact Low rates hurt custody banks by reducing the return they make on lending and on their own investments. The U.S. Federal Reserve has held its benchmark interest rate at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 in an attempt to stimulate borrowing and economic growth. Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend securities for institutional investors, including mutual funds, pension funds and hedge funds. Northern Trust also manages investments for individuals and institutions. Results were announced before the start of regular U.S. trading. Northern Trust gained 7.3 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a 15 percent advance by the Standard & Poor’s 20-company index of asset managers and custody banks. BNY Mellon is scheduled to released earnings tomorrow, followed by State Street on April 19. (Northern Trust is scheduled to hold a conference call for investors at 10 a.m. New York time. The call can be accessed at http://www.northerntrust/financialreleases .)\n"

       "   Consider allocating investments among emerging areas like Internet-connected devices, mobile health, human-computer interface technologies, cloud-data centers, and mobile privacy. These areas are projected for significant growth, as highlighted by initiatives such as Samsung’s Catalyst Fund focusing on innovation and development.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Opportunities in Venture Capital**\n",
       "   Investing in funds or companies that support early-stage technology startups can be lucrative. Samsung, for example, is increasing its venture-capital funding to $1.1 billion to advance tech startups in vital sectors. Participate in funds with similar growth objectives.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Mobile Application Platforms**\n",
       "   Companies like Kony Solutions, preparing for IPOs, indicate strong growth potential within mobile application development platforms. This area is expected to see a yearly growth rate of 39% through 2016.\n",

       "\n",
       "### 5. **Investment in Established Growth Funds**\n",
       "   Review technology-heavy mutual funds like Mairs & Power Growth Fund. Such funds consistently outperform peers with a disciplined, long-term approach to tech investments. They could serve as a safer entry into the sector.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 6. **Explore International Opportunities**\n",
       "   Emerging markets with high-tech potential, such as South Korea, Mexico, and Brazil, can offer opportunities for broader exposure to technology advancements globally.\n",
       "\n",

       "Apple Sells More Phones Over the Weekend Than BlackBerry Did Last Quarter\n",
       "\n",
       "Just about the only thing Apple and BlackBerry still have in common is that they're both named after fruit. On Friday, when Apple fanatics were lined up outside stores around the world for the release of the new iPhones, BlackBerry said it would cut 4,500 jobs and write down as much as $960 million in its fiscal second quarter BlackBerry, which released the flagship Z10 touchscreen phone earlier this year, sold 5.9 million smartphones during the last three months. Apple sold more than 9 million over the weekend. The companies' different trajectories became even more vivid today when BlackBerry said it tentatively agreed to a $4.7 billion buyout by a group led by Fairfax Financial Holdings. Meanwhile, Apple's stock rose 5 percent following the sales announcement, giving the California company a market value of almost $446 billion. In the mobile industry, giants fall fast and hard. Device sales for the once-mighty BlackBerry \"are cratering,\" said Jan Dawson, an analyst at research firm Ovum. Compare that with Apple, which said today the debut of the iPhone 5s and 5c set a sales record for the company. It was the first time Apple began selling its new iPhones in the crucial Chinese market on launch day, which no doubt helped to exceed goals. Apple also said quarterly revenue and gross margin will be at the top end of its prior forecast. During Apple's last quarter -- before the new phones came out -- the company took in $18.2 billion in revenue from the iPhone unit, which doesn't include accessories, software or services. BlackBerry expects its entire company to generate $1.6 billion in revenue in the second quarter. You'd have to add up BlackBerry's last seven quarters of revenue to reach what Apple generated from selling smartphones in one quarter. And it wasn't even a particularly great one for Apple.\n",

       "Apple CEO Cook Says China Will Overtake U.S. as Biggest Market\n",
       "\n",
       "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said China will overtake the U.S. to become its largest market, as the iPhone-maker adds more stores and considers debuting new products in the country. “I believe it will become our first,” Cook said in an interview with state-owned Xinhua News yesterday. No timeframe was given for the prediction. The Cupertino, California-based company had $5.7 billion of sales in China during the quarter ended September. U.S. revenue was about $14.4 billion, based on figures in an Oct. 25 earnings statement. Cook also met the chairman of China Mobile Ltd. (941) while in the country, as he seeks to boost cooperation with a wireless operator that has 707 million customers and no agreement to sell iPhones. The CEO is making his second visit to the country in less than a year as Apple tries to reverse its shrinking share of the local smartphone market. Apple intends to open “many more” outlets in China over the next several years, Cook said in the Xinhua interview. The company now has 11 stores in China and Hong Kong. Cook also said he would also “love” to introduce new products in China first, according to the report. The iPhone 5 was released in China in December, almost three months after the U.S. introduction. China Growth The company’s growth in the world’s most populous nation has been limited by it only working with smaller carriers and competition from domestic phone-makers. Its share of the nation’s smartphone market slipped to sixth from fourth in the third quarter, according to researcher IDC. Yesterday, Cook met with Xi Guohua, the chairman on China Mobile at the carrier’s headquarters in Beijing. The two discussed “cooperation,” according to a statement from China Mobile, the world’s largest wireless operator by subscribers. It didn’t elaborate. China Mobile, which accounts for 64 percent of the nation’s mobile users, said last month that it needs to reach agreements on benefit-sharing with Apple before it can begin offering iPhones. The operator also has a homegrown third-generation network that isn’t used by other carriers. Apple distributes iPhone with the nation’s second- and third-largest carriers: China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) and China Telecom Corp.

       "ARM Sees Shift to Cheaper Smartphones Boosting Chip Royalty\n",
       "\n",
       "ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) , the U.K. chip designer whose products power Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhones, predicts a shift in demand toward lower-priced smartphones will help boost royalty revenue. “There is a shift advantage for ARM as mid-range and entry smartphones drive smartphone growth. We’ve got that dynamic going into next year,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said at a conference in Barcelona yesterday. “Those phones generate much more royalty for ARM because they use more silicon.” ARM has had five consecutive years of revenue growth as its designs for chips that control graphics and processing were used in increasingly popular smartphones and tablets. Royalty payments took the spotlight last quarter as they missed analysts’ estimates. ARM shares have fallen almost 9 percent since the earnings report on Oct. 22. “As ARM technology becomes more sophisticated, the royalty percentage goes up,” Score said. “On average, it’s going to very gradually go up.” Global smartphone shipments surged 40 percent last quarter, slowing from 53 percent growth for the previous three-month period, according to researcher IDC. The average selling prices of the devices fell by 13 percent to $317 from a year earlier, because of demand for more affordable handsets. In spite of concerns about slowing growth, especially in China, Score said ARM can continue expanding its customer base and outperforming the semiconductor market in the next five years, driven by cheaper handsets, enterprise networking and micro-controllers. ARM shares fell less than 1 percent to 953.50 pence at 9:16 a.m. in London. New Chief Chief Executive Officer Simon Segars, who succeeded Warren East in July, is confronting a shift in the industry’s growth to low-end smartphones and new entrant Intel Corp. (INTC) , which has begun designing its own chips for mobile phones. ARM, based in Cambridge, England, is also seeking to boost its market share in servers as companies from Facebook Inc. (FB) to Google Inc. (GOOG) look for lower-power machines to drive their data centers. It’s “possible to identify such a market and build a chip specifically for that market, whether it is to handle only storage or only video loading, for example. We can make the chip much more efficient,” Score said at the annual Technology, Media and Telecoms Conference organized by Morgan Stanley. “Everyone knows Intel has a very strong ecosystem around servers, we’re not kidding ourselves,” Score said. “For that reason we see it as further out.”\n",

       "Samsung Falls After JPMorgan Cuts Estimates on Galaxy S4\n",
       "\n",
       "Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s largest smartphone maker, fell the most in more than nine months in Seoul after analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut profit estimates, citing slowing demand for its flagship Galaxy S4. The shares declined 6.2 percent to 1,427,000 won as of the close of trade, the largest drop since Aug. 27. The stock was the biggest drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific index. Orders for the S4 smartphone, which went on sale last month, are slowing on weak demand in Europe that may impact profit margins, analysts led by JJ Park said in a report dated yesterday, citing supply chain checks. JPMorgan cut its share-price estimate for Samsung by 9.5 percent to 1.9 million won and lowered its 2013 earnings estimates by 9 percent. “Compared to S3, S4 had stronger momentum in the first quarter of launch,” the analysts wrote, affirming their overweight rating on the stock. “But the following quarter’s shipment is expected to be disappointing and its peak-quarter number seems way below our previous estimates.” JPMorgan now expects Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung’s shipments of the S4 to be 60 million this year, compared with a previous estimate of 80 million. Samsung sold 10 million units of the S4 within 27 days, the company said. It also unveiled a smaller, less-powerful version of the phone last week.\n",

       "Nokia Rises on Report Huawei Considering Acquisition\n",
       "\n",
       "Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) pared a 12 percent surge in U.S. trading after Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies Co. refuted a report that it was interested in acquiring the struggling Finnish handset maker. Nokia’s American depositary receipts rose 4.6 percent to $3.86 at the close in New York yesterday. Earlier, they had jumped as high as $4.12 after the Financial Times reported that Huawei is “considering these sorts of acquisitions,” according to Richard Yu, head of the company’s consumer business. He said a combination with Nokia would have “some synergies,” according to the FT. Huawei has “no plans” to acquire Nokia, the Chinese company said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “In the whole history of our company, we have done very few, very small acquisitions,” Scott Sykes, a spokesman for Huawei, said in a phone interview today. One of the first smartphone makers, Espoo, Finland-based Nokia has lost market share as customer preferences have shifted to touchscreen handsets like Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ’s Galaxy. Huawei, a maker of telecommunications networking gear, has been pushing into the handset market. The company accounted for 4.3 percent of the world’s smartphone shipments in the first quarter, up from 3.4 percent a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nokia’s share slipped to 2.8 percent last year from 7.8 percent a year earlier. Samsung led the market in the first quarter with 32 percent, followed by Apple with 17 percent. Chris Hollis, a Nokia spokesman, declined to comment.\n"

       "Based on recent trends and market performance in the smartphone industry, here’s an investment strategy:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Focus on Industry Leaders**: Apple's strong product sales, revenue growth, and global expansion (especially in China) make it a leading contender. Its focus on high-margin products and an expanding ecosystem provide stable long-term investment opportunities.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Diversification for Growth in Emerging Markets**: While premium models dominate developed markets, the rising demand for affordable smartphones indicates growth for companies targeting mid-to-low price segments, such as Xiaomi and ARM Holdings.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Caution with Market Volatility**: Samsung's struggles with flagship Galaxy models suggest a potential risk to profitability. Monitor market trends carefully and focus on companies innovating in product features or expanding revenue streams.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Consider Strategic Partnerships**: Huawei’s rise in market share signals potential synergies. However, acquisition rumors and limited historical acquisitions show uncertainty. Exercise caution with investment in such companies unless clear strategic benefits emerge.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Avoid Legacy Brands**: Brands like BlackBerry and Nokia have shown significant declines in market share and profitability. Avoid investments in companies struggling to adapt to modern consumer demands.\n",
       "\n",
       "Conclusion: For stable returns, prioritize Apple. For higher risk-reward dynamics, consider companies like ARM Holdings or Xiaomi targeting growth markets. Regularly review global smartphone market trends to adapt this strategy."
